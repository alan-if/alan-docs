# The Alan IF Logo

This folder contains the Alan logo in vector format, reconstructed by Tristano Ajmone using Photoshop shapes. The logo can be losslessly scaled to any size, and then saved to a raster image format according to needs.

- [`Alan-Logo.psd`][Logo PSD] — original Photoshop 7 vector file.
- [`Alan-Logo.tif`][Logo TIFF] — vector logo saved as TIFF.
- [`alan-logo_preview_x500.png`][Logo x500] — Logo raster preview (500x PNG).

![Alan Logo][Logo x500]

> __TIFF NOTE__ — The "`Alan-Logo.tif`" file was created by saving the `.psd` file as TIFF (using ZIP compression) within Photoshop; therefore, its contents are the same as the Photoshop file. It was provided as a convenience for those working with image applications other than Photoshop. Beware that not every application that recognizes the TIFF format supports all the features of this format.
