# Styling Conventions

In order to provide a pleasant reading and learning experience, we strive to apply consistent styling within a same document and (possibly) across all the Alan related documentation.

For this reason, we ask editors and contributors to read the _Formatting and Styling Conventions_ document and follow its guidelines:

- [`CONVENTIONS.md`][CONVENTIONS] — _Formatting and Styling Conventions_ guidelines.


# Submitting New Contents via Branches

If you would like to submit new contents to a document, and you're not its author, we aks you to submit them via a dedicated branch, instead of using `master` branch — ie, even if you have priviledges to publish directly in `master`, you should submit major content changes on a dedicated branch.

This approach allows the original author of the document ro review and discuss the proposed contents before merging them in `master`. Unlike minor editing changes (fixing typos, text formatting and sytles), content changes should be approved by the original author of a document before being merged into the main branch.

Since editors will receive administrative rights to publish changes directly into `master` branch (to provide them freedom of action to work while porting and editing documents), this guideline is a reminder that any major changes to a document creatred by someone else should be subject to that author's approval.
