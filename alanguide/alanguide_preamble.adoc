.About This Document
********************************************************************************
This excellent guide was written by Michael Arnaud back in 2006.
It was published on the https://alanif.se/files/alanguide/alanguide.html[Alan website], where its still available as a web page, but the original sources were lost.
The original Guide was written in a format that made it possible to generate various output formats.
Today the format of choice with those properties is https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc].

In 2014, Thomas Nilefalk started converting it to AsciiDoc from HTML, the only format in which the Guide had survived.
The styles and formatting restoration work wasn't completed, and this document takes on from where Thomas left.
The intention is to recreate the original styles of the Guide, or at least preserve the original intentions of the Guide's author.

Thomas also started updating the contents, for both Alan has and the Standard Library have evolved since the original document (2006).

The library referenced in this guide is no longer current.
Anssi RÃ¤isanen has made huge efforts in creating a newer and better library -- currently at version 2.1, and available on https://github.com/AnssiR66/AlanStdLib[GitHub].

Among the goals of this document reconstruction is updating its contents to the Standard Library v2.1.
