# Welcome to The Alan IF Documentation Project

Here you will find the latest and greatest version of various documentation for the Alan Interactive Fiction Language, tools and libraries.

## The Manual

The Language manual is the primary documentation of the Alan language from an authors point of view.

It exists in two versions matching the two current development flows:

- The Beta Manual - describes the most recent Beta release of the Alan SDK
  + [HTML](manual-beta/manual.html)
  + [PDF](manual-beta/manual.pdf)
- The Alpha Manual - includes changes that are only in the development snapshots which will make it into the next beta release
  + [HTML](manual-alpha/manual.html)
  + [PDF](manual-alpha/manual.pdf)

## Alan Design Documents (VERY RUDIMENTARY AND PRELIMINARY!)

These documents are still incomplete, but the might be helpful to better understand technical aspects about Alan and its design principles.
