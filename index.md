# Welcome to The Alan Documentation Project

Here you will find the latest and greatest version of various documentation for the Alan Interactive Fiction Language, tools and libraries.

## The Manual

The Language manual is the primary documentation of the Alan language from an authors point of view.

It exists in two versions matching the two current development flows:

- The Beta Manual - describes the most recent Beta release of the Alan SDK ([HTML](manual-beta/manual.html"), [PDF](manual-beta/manual.pdf))
- The Alpha Manual - includes changes that are only in the development snapshots which will make it into the next beta release ([HTML](manual-alpha/manual.html"), [PDF](manual-alpha/manual.pdf))
