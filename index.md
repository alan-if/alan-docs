# Welcome to The Alan IF Documentation Project

Here you will find the latest and greatest version of various documentation for the [Alan Interactive Fiction Language], tools and libraries.

## The Manual

The Language manual is the primary documentation of the Alan language from an author's point of view.

It exists in two versions matching the two current development flows:

- **The Beta Manual** — describes the most recent Beta release of the [Alan SDK]
    + [HTML](manual-beta/manual.html)
    + [PDF](manual-beta/manual.pdf)
- **The Alpha Manual** — includes changes that are only in the [development snapshots] which will make it into the next beta release

## Alan Cookbook

The ALAN Cookbook, by [Anssi Räisänen], contains an extensive list of tips and tricks on how to program various things and achieve various effects in the ALAN language.
It covers both basic things available in the Alan language, and more advanced topics supported by the [Standard Library v2].
