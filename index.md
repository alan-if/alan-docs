# Welcome to The Alan IF Documentation Project

Here you will find the latest and greatest version of various documentation for the [Alan Interactive Fiction Language], tools and libraries.

It exists in two versions matching the two current development flows:

    + [HTML](manual-beta/manual.html)
    + [PDF](manual-beta/manual.pdf)
- **The Alpha Manual** — includes changes that are only in the [development snapshots] which will make it into the next beta release
    + [HTML](manual-alpha/manual.html)
    + [PDF](manual-alpha/manual.pdf)
