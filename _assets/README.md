# Shared Assets Folder

This folder stores assets that are (or might be) shared by multiple documents — images, stylesheets, fonts, etc. As a rule of thumb, any assets that could be reused by other documents (present or future) should be stored within this folder tree; but if a particular asset is going to be used only by a single document, then it should be placed in that document's main folder.

# Assets Tree

- [`/images/`](./images)
- [`/xsl-fopub/`](./xsl-fopub) — XSL PDF Stylesheets used by asciidoctor-fopub.
