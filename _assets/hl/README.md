# Folder Contents

- [`/haml/`][haml] — customized Haml HTML5 templates.
- [`/adoc/`][adoc] — Asciidoctor assets:
    + [`/highlight-treeprocessor_mod.rb`][rb] — extension for Highlight integration.

There are no build scripts in this folder, as the documents requiring these assets will have their own scripts to import them; but since the assets are commonly shared by all documents using Highlight, we'll keep a single copy of the assets here.

# System Requirements

To build the document from AsciiDoc to HTML you'll need to install the following tools:

- [Highlight]
- [Ruby] + [Asciidoctor]
