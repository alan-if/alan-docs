# About The XSL Stylesheets

The original XSL stylesheets in this folder tree were taken from the "`/src/dist/docbook-xsl/`" folder of the [asciidoctor-fopub] project, Copyright (C) 2013 Dan Allen (MIT License):

- https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub/tree/9afeab8/src/dist/docbook-xsl

They were subsequently edited by Tristano Ajmone to adapt them to the styling needs of the _Alan Manual_ project. The adaptation work may include deleting some of the original files, as well as adding new ones.

## Customizations

The original stylesheets are being customized to resemble the original layout and styles of the _Alan Manaul_. The idea is that of creating a dedicated PDF template shared by all the Alan documentation.

For more details and references on customizing the template, see:

- [`DEV_NOTES.md`](./DEV_NOTES.md)


### Syntax Highlighting

The changes include the creation of an Alan language definition for the FOP syntax highlighter that ships with [asciidoctor-fopub], and setting a dedicate color scheme for Alan code examples blocks.

> _**WIP**_ â€” More details will be added to this document once ultimated the customization of the Alan syntax and scheme.
