# About The XSL Stylesheets

The original XSL stylesheets in this folder tree were taken from the "`/src/dist/docbook-xsl/`" folder of the [asciidoctor-fopub] project, Copyright (C) 2013 Dan Allen (MIT License):

- https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub/tree/9afeab8/src/dist/docbook-xsl

They were subsequently edited by Tristano Ajmone to adapt them to the styling needs of the _Alan Manual_ project. The adaptation work may include deleting some of the original files, as well as adding new ones.

## Customizations

The original stylesheets are being customized to resemble the original layout and styles of the _Alan Manaul_. The idea is that of creating a dedicated PDF template shared by all the Alan documentation.

For more details and references on customizing the template, see:

- [`DEV_NOTES.md`](./DEV_NOTES.md)


### Syntax Highlighting

The changes include the creation of an Alan language definition for the FOP syntax highlighter that ships with [asciidoctor-fopub], and setting a dedicate color scheme for Alan code examples blocks.

> _**WIP**_ â€” More details will be added to this document once ultimated the customization of the Alan syntax and scheme.

## Tech Specs

asciidoctor-fopub uses the following components versions:

| Software Project            | Version |
| :-------------------------- | :------ |
| Apache FOP                  | 2.1     |
| DocBook XSL                 | 1.78.1  |
| Apache Commons XML Resolver | 1.2     |
| Xalan                       | 2.6.0   |
| JEuclid                     | 3.1.9   |
| XSLTHL                      | 2.1.0   |
| Gradle                      | 2.0     |

# Important Usage Note

In order to use these XSL Stylesheets, your invoking script must set the working path to the "`_assets`" folder of the repository! This is due to the fact that the "`fop-config.xml`" configuration file uses relative paths to find the fonts folder:

```xml
        <!-- Register all the fonts found in this directory -->
        <directory recursive="true">fonts</directory>
```

Therefore, the invoking script must CD to the "`_assets`" folder being invoking asciidoctor-fopub. This also means that you'll have to use an absolute path for the DocBook source file, and that you'll only need to pass `-t xsl-fopub` to inform asciidoctor-fopub about where to find the XSL Stylesheets.

As an example, look at the various batch scripts in this folder. You'll notice that they all store the current directory and then swtich to the "`_assets`" folder before invoking asciidoctor-fopub. Here is a simplified example:

```batch
:: (we are starting inside "manual\" folder!!!)

:: Preseve current directory:
SET "CURRDIR=%CD%"

:: Define path to "_assets" folder:
SET "ASSETSDIR=..\_assets\"

:: Covnert from AsciiDoc to DocBook via Asciidoctor:
CALL asciidoctor^
  -b docbook^
  -d book^
  -a data-uri!^
  --safe-mode unsafe^
  --verbose^
  manual.asciidoc

:: Need to switch working directory to "_assets" for FOP:
CD %ASSETSDIR%

CALL fopub^
  -t xsl-fopub^
  %CURRDIR%\manual.xml

:: Restore origignal script working directory:
CD %CURRDIR%
@EXIT /B
```

Unfortunately, I couldn't find a better solution to handle a XSL Stylesheets folder commonly shared by different documents inside a repository shared across different machine. But since the automated scripts do all the work for you, you won't have to worry about this unless you are actively developing the project.
