= Language Grammar

== Description

In this manual, the Alan language is defined using a BNF-form, which you can see in most descriptions.
The grammar is a set of rules defining what constructs are legal in the source for an Alan program.
Below follows a brief explanation on how to interpret these rules by using some short examples.
For details on the actual rules, refer to the content of <<Language Reference>>.

The ((BNF)) form divides the rules for structure of the input source by describing it in smaller parts, which may in turn be defined by other rules.
For example, a rule might say that an *ADVENTURE* (in this case an Alan program) consists of options, declarations and a start section.
This grammar rule would look like:
(((BNF, rules of, adventure)))

[source,bnf]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
adventure = [options] {declaration} start_section
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each item that is an identifier (`options`, `declaration`, etc.), is a construct that in turn is defined by other rules, possibly elsewhere in the manual.

The equal sign (`=`) may be read as "`consists of`" or "`is defined as`".
Optional parts are surrounded by square brackets (`[` and `]`).
Parts that may be repeated are enclosed in curly braces (`{` and `}`).

// @NOTE: Backend differentation.
//    For the following illustration I've used a different source block for the
//    HTML and PDF Backends:
//
//      * HTML BACKEND: Example block with horiziontal description list.
//      * PDF BACKEND: Verbatim listing block.
//
//    The reason for this is that the example block looks much nicer in HTML,
//    but turns out hugly in the PDF --- the example frame was square and
//    hugly, and if you add a title it ends up inside the frame, and most of all
//    it adds huge space between left- and right-handside of list elements.
//
//    If I can fix a way to fix these problems in the XSL template, I should use
//    the example block for the PDF too, instead of the listing block.

// ==================
// HTML Backend Only:
// ==================
ifeval::["{backend}" == "html5"]
===========================
[horizontal]
=   :: -> {nbsp} '`is defined as`'

[ ] :: -> {nbsp} '`optional`'

{ } :: -> {nbsp} '`zero or more times`'
===========================
endif::[]
// ==================
// Non HTML Backends:
// ==================
ifeval::["{backend}" != "html5"]
.........................
=  : 'is defined as'

[] : 'optional'

{} : 'zero or more times'
.........................
endif::[]


So the rule might be read as "`an adventure consists of *options* which are optional, zero or more *declarations* and a *start_section*`".

If the item to the left of the equal sign may be defined in multiple ways, the alternatives are divided by a vertical bar (`|`).
For example:

[source,bnf]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
declaration = messages
            | class
            | instance
            | verb
            | rule
            | synonyms
            | syntax
            | verb
            | event
            | addition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This definition says that a *declaration* might be messages, a class definition, an instance declaration, etc.

The basic components of the language are reserved words and symbols.
These are represented in the rules by quoted strings of characters.
These are not defined elsewhere, but should instead be written as indicated.
Character case is not significant.

[source,bnf]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
random_expression = 'RANDOM' 'IN' expression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reserved words `Random` and `In` must be followed by an expression (which, to make sense, must refer to a `container` instance) to form a *random_expression* (which in itself is an expression).

== Keywords

The following is a complete list of all keywords in the Alan language.
Note that they can still be used as identifiers in a source file if the rules described in <<_words_identifiers_and_names>> are followed.
Basically this means that if you surround them by single quotes they can be used as identifiers in your source code anyway.
This might be especially important if you want to use any of these words as words the player might want to input, such as part of a name for an item.

// For maintaiance conveniance, we'll use a CVS Table here: it can be easily
// updated (if the need arises) and it could allow to control the number of columns
// on a per-format basis, via custom attributes.
// Keywords are cased following the styling conventions adopted in the document.

[NOTE]
================================================================================
Although the Alan language is case-insensitive, the keywords in the above list are cased according to the styling conventions adopted in this document, for the sake of consistency and to provide an intuitive association between keywords and their role in the language.
