<h2 id="_introduction">1. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text adventures or, using a more appropriate term, interactive fiction, is a form of computer game which has many things in common with fiction in book form, role-playing games and puzzle-solving. To create a high quality interactive fiction game, you need to be more of an author than a programmer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alan is a special purpose computer language specifically designed to make it very easy to create such adventure games requiring only limited programming skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main principle of the design of the language is simplicity. That is, it should be very easy to do common things, but it should also be possible to do more complicated things by constructs that are more complex. This means that wherever a construct is optional, the system supplies some sensible default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The author and a very good friend designed the first crude version of the Alan language in 1985. During many years of incremental improvement and use, it has now reached its third major version. This means that the language has a sound foundation, based on practical use. Therefore, features have been added as experience have grown, from actual use and understanding of the most prioritised needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this version modern and novel object orientation features has been incorporated into the language that allows definition of classes, instantiation and inheritance of attributes and other features. Do not worry if you find these terms incomprehensible at this point, Alan is still an easy language to use and by reading this manual, you will understand how these new features may aid you in your quest for adventures.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_programmers_pitch">1.1. Programmer&#8217;s Pitch</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alan is an application-oriented language. It features constructs that are natural to an author of Interactive Fiction. Alan is a strictly typed, compiled, object-oriented language with single inheritance. Classes inherit properties from their super-classes. The class system allows polymorphism so that instances of subclasses are valid wherever a super-class is specified. There are no explicit type declarations, except for instances of classes; instead, types are automatically inferred from expressions such as integers, strings or instances of a particular class.</p>

<h2 id="_concepts">2. Concepts</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter introduces the concepts used in the Alan language. You might already have a good idea about these things, especially if you are a seasoned adventure player, and perhaps even author.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But I would suggest that you read through it anyway since it introduces some important concepts that are specific to how Alan treats them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_an_adventure">2.1. What Is An Adventure?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as man has been around there have been stories, fairy tales and fantasies. In the early days, storytellers told their stories to silent and astonished audiences. After Gutenberg, the stories were printed and the readers partook in the fantasies of the author. In our days, passive viewers are fed from the silver screen or through the tube.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our time, at last, there has evolved a way for the &#8220;audience&#8221; to take part in the story themselves. It started in the forties and fifties and continued to develop into the games today known as Dungeon and Dragons, Tunnels and Trolls, etc. Games where a game leader designs the story, but the players decide (and perform) the actions of the characters in the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These games, of course, have a computerized counterpart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These games are played interacting with the computer. The program describes a scene or situation (usually in text, but pictures may also be used), the player decides on some action and gives orders to the computer to carry out his wishes. Usually there are objects to manipulate, traps to negotiate and puzzles to solve, the object being to find the hidden treasures or save the world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Crowther &amp; Woods started this form of games in the late sixties when they designed the famous <em>Colossal Cave Adventure,</em> which became available on many mainframe computer systems. Inspired by this, Lebling et.al (then at MIT) took a giant step forward in adventuring by creating the Great Underground Empire and making it available for venturing Adventurers in the game Dungeon. This game contained a much more developed story and could handle much more complex commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, Dave Lebling &amp; Co started Infocom, a company where they continued to develop their technique, first with <em>Zork I</em>, <em>II</em> and <em>III</em> (the first a re-implementation of Dungeon, the others equally successful sequels). Since then, a host of games has been released (<em>Starcross</em>, <em>Witness</em>, <em>Enchanter</em> are some of the names that come to mind). Although the original authors are long scattered, the Infocom games are still highly appreciated even today.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other companies have followed Infocom&#8217;s example and a handful of them seem to make a living out of creating adventure games. However, today most of the works are created by devoted people that do it for the fun of it, releasing their games as shareware or completely free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There have been many attempts to use computer graphics to display the surroundings and objects in adventure games. Some of the more successful early examples are the Sierra games (notably the <em>Leisure Suit Larry</em> and the <em>Kings Quest</em> series) which had mouse oriented moves but also allowed single line text commands, games from ICOM Simulations (<em>DejaVu</em> and <em>The Uninvited</em>) which were purely graphics games with mouse and icon interfaces. Other manufacturers have tried to use (sometimes optional) pictures to accompany the text, for example Magnetic Scrolls games (e.g. <em>the Pawn</em>), which shift the picture automatically as you move around using the normal directional commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, a community of addicted authors and players of text-based adventure games are still out there. Visit the vaults of interactive fiction on the Internet, and you will be surprised by the abundance of modern, high quality interactive fiction available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan Adventure Language has been designed to aid construction primarily of pure text adventures or, in the words of Infocom, interactive fiction. Some sound and graphics functions are also available to spice up your game if you so desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main feature of adventures is the interaction between the player and the game through commands input through the keyboard and descriptions printed on the screen. In <a href="#_a_sample_interaction">Appendix B</a> you can find such a sample interaction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_elements_of_adventures">2.2. Elements Of Adventures</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The success of all Infocom games can probably be attributed to three distinctive features. First, they all have a &#8216;believable&#8217; and consistent plot, which is flavoured with humour and wittiness. Second, the descriptions are extensive and give a lot of atmosphere to the game. Third, the command handler recognizes and understands a large vocabulary and complex input. Add to this the worlds best graphics device (the human brain) and you are unbeatable!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Looking at adventures in more detail, we can see some common features. There is always the world or universe (called the map) where the adventure is taking place. Although you can move around quite freely there are usually some problems getting into certain parts of the world (e.g. locked doors, no air to breathe or even finding the entrance). The size of the map ranges from hundreds of locations to just two or three, or even a single location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, there are the objects in the game. These range from your tools, like lamps and shovels, to immaterial things like a hole in the ground, in short, anything you can manipulate. Ideally, everything that is mentioned in a description should be an object, but this is normally impossible because of storage limits (and perhaps the stamina of the games designer!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most objects have uses. You can easily guess how to use a key, but what about the velvet pillow? Red herring objects are also common in adventuring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player must be able to express his wishes. Complete understanding of natural language commands from the player is probably overkill, but single verb-object input is not sufficient for a good game either. The player must be able to say things like</p>

<h3 id="_alan_fundamentals">2.3. Alan Fundamentals</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alan is all about adventure games, or interactive fiction. In this manual, we will use both terms interchangeably since they convey two slightly different views on the purpose. But the technical platform, the Alan language and its support system, is the same, works the same and looks the same, regardless if you are designing a treasure hunt featuring an elaborate combat and hit point system or if you are competing with Sir William Shakespeare himself.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_a_language">What Is A Language?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A computer language is usually described as a set of rules for textual instructions for a computer. The idea is that a computer can follow those rules and perform the necessary and/or intended actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan Adventure Language is a high-level computer language designed to make it easy to create text adventures. This means that the language have been designed so that the textual instructions are relatively easy to read and write if you understand the mechanisms that adventures are made from. In addition, it requires only for minimal additional instructions to make those mechanisms work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compared to programming in a typical programming language, the Alan system handles most of the tiresome tasks and supplies reasonable defaults so that you can concentrate on the plot, the puzzles, the objects and the map. This makes Alan a true high-level computer language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan <em>system</em> consists of two computer programs, one of which analyses an input following (or at least intended to follow) the Alan <em>language</em>. This program is called the <em>compiler</em> and the analysis ensures that the input (the game description, in fact) makes sense. The compiler also, at the same time, converts the input into something more compact, the game file. This game file can be transferred and used without the compiler. Instead, to run an adventure the <em>interpreter</em> is needed. The interpreter is another program that reads the information in the game file, communicates with the player of the game (or reader of the work, if you like) and interprets all the complex mechanisms in your game logic so that it gives the player the illusion of the activities and events that you have designed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create works of interactive fiction using Alan, you also need a program with which to construct your Alan source code, a standard text editor, like Notepad or similar programs. However, you cannot use a word processor, like Microsoft Word, since the files created with those usually contains formatting information that the Alan compiler don&#8217;t understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also special editors, or additions to standard editors, available, which supports Alan coding and helps with formatting and even compiling and running your game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might wonder why the game is not a single executable program. The answer is simple, compare the game with a Word-document. In order for the document to be visible, you need the Word-program that reads the Word-file and displays the content on the screen. As you probably know, the same program does not run on all computers. For example, you cannot install Word for Windows on a Macintosh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In view of this, it might be considered a nice thing that there are programs for Macintosh that read, display and print Word-documents. This makes the document files portable. Once you have a reading program on your computer, you can use all similar files on it. This is also one reason behind the compiler-interpreter design of Alan.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_alan_idea">The Alan Idea</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan language does not focus on variables, subroutines or other traditional programming constructs, because Alan is not primarily a <em>programming</em> language. Instead, Alan takes a descriptive view of the concepts of adventure authoring. The Alan language contains constructs that make it possible for you, the author, to describe the various features of these concepts. By describing for example, how the locations in the adventure are connected you have described the geography in which the story will take place. Much of what should be described is in terms of ordinary text shown to make the player experience the story that you have designed by reading them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will still need to understand how to vary your output depending on various conditions or information, how the player input controls which events will happen, how to connect one location to another and how to store information for later use. In a way this is programming, but in an unusual sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to understand the rules of the Alan language, which this manual is all about, it is necessary to first establish some common ground. As an author you will have to have the same view as the Alan language has on some fundamentals of what a work of interactive fiction is all about.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_whats_happening">What&#8217;s Happening?</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The execution of an adventure is primarily driven by the input of player commands. A command is analysed by the interpreter program according to the player command syntax allowed by the author and, if understood, transformed into execution of verbs or movements, which in turn may trigger other parts in the game as described in the Alan source. After a player turn, other, scripted non-player characters or actors, can move, controlled by the computer, again according to the definitions in the source. Scheduled events are then run, and then the player takes another turn. This is described in more detail in <a href="#_a_turn_of_events">Sect. 5.1</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following sections describe a number of the fundamental concepts that are present in an adventure game and what the Alan view of them is.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_map">The Map</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scene for the game is a map of a number of connected locations. A location has a description that is presented to the player when that location is entered. A location may also have a number of exits stating in which direction there are exits and to which locations they lead. Alan places no restrictions on the layout of the map, any topology is allowed.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Alan, exits are always one-way, and an explicit declaration of a backward path (if such is desired) must be made. Although, normally you would probably want them to be two-way, if they where automatically two-way, it would be very hard to handle the rare, but important, cases when you want them to not be.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_things">The Things</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most objects in an adventure are things that in real life would be objects too, like a knife or a key. In addition, other things that should be possible to manipulate by the player, e.g. parts of the scenery, must be declared as an object. For example if you require the player to &#8216;whistle the melody&#8217;, then the melody must be an Alan object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects, like locations, have a description that is presented when they are encountered during the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every object may also have a set of properties, like edible and movable, which may be changed during the execution of an Alan program. Most objects would e.g. probably not be edible so there is also a mechanism for declaring how these properties should be set by default, as well as mechanisms to override them, both for a particular object and for groups of objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some player actions (verbs) have special meaning or effects when applied to a certain object. These verbs and their special effects are also declared within the object declaration.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_other_people_and_monsters">Other People and Monsters</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An extra thrill and dimension are additional characters in the game. In Alan, these are called actors and may have a life of their own. For each move the player makes, these programmed characters also get a turn to do their thing. An actor may be a thief running around and stealing your collected treasures or a dragon guarding the entrance to its lair.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actors get their behaviour from scripts that step, by step, describes what is going to happen for each player interaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the interesting things about playing adventure games with actors is to figure out how to interact with and influence the other characters.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_acting">Acting</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player commands action by typing imperative statements. These statements are analysed and results in execution (&#8220;calls&#8221;) to verbs. The effects of these commands must be declared in verbs by the game author, either in an object (describing the effects of the verb when applied to an object) or as a general (global) verb that only applies without object.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_input">The Input</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make it possible for the player to input more complex commands a means to specify the syntax for a verb is also available. A particular syntax is connected to a verb and describes how the player must phrase his input in order to command the triggering of a particular verb. Using this mechanism, verbs can also be made to operate on literals (strings and integers) giving the player the possibility to input things like</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_introduction_to_the_language">2.4. Introduction to the Language</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alan is an adventure language, i.e. a language designed to make it easy to write adventures. This means that constructs in the Alan language reflects the various concepts encountered when creating an adventure plot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common step after having come up with a plot for your adventure is to draw a map of the world where the adventure is taking place. For this purpose, we use <code>Location</code>s.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step is to introduce tools, weapons and other objects possible to manipulate. These are the <code>Object</code>s.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then the player will need words to command action. The Alan language construct to supply these with is the <code>Verb</code>. Using the <code>Syntax</code> construct, you can also define more complex player input.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, you may also want other characters and creatures in your adventure. For this the <code>Actor</code> class is provided.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_notation">Notation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this document, there are some typographical clues. Example Alan source code is typeset in separate sections with a mono-spaced font:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>This is an example of some source code.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will also encounter sample game-play which will be formatted using a surrounding border (like paper&#8230;&#8203;) thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock gametranscript">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Grandma&#8217;s House</strong><br>
You are outside your grandma&#8217;s house.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later in the manual, you will find semi-formal definitions, grammar rules, for how various constructs may be constructed. These sections are typeset against a coloured background:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ebnf" data-lang="ebnf">The rules for the rules are available in <a href="#_language_grammar">Appendix D</a>.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In running text, words that are keywords or signify an Alan construct is written in a mono-spaced, bold, font. This helps distinguish the English word &#8216;the&#8217; from the Alan keyword <code>The</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown in the last example, Alan keywords are written with the first letter capitalized. This is simply a convention and has no effect other than the visual. A keyword can be written <code>Keyword</code>, <code>KEYWORD</code>, <code>keyword</code>, or even <code>KeYwOrD</code> (if you are keen to show how good you are with a keyboard&#8230;&#8203;). This manual tries to be consistent with using the first version (except in grammar rules).</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_locations">The Locations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scene for your adventure is a series of &#8220;rooms&#8221; or, rather, locations. Locations are connected by exits, leading out of one location into another. This makes it possible for the hero to travel through the world of your design, exploring it and solving the puzzles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is required if we want to describe a location? Every location must have an identifier. This is so that you, the designer, may refer to that location easily, instead of having to remember a magic number for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unless you plan to provide other means for transportation from a location, you should also describe in which directions there are <code>Exit</code>s and to which locations they lead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, this is all that is necessary in a location, so lets look at an example.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The kitchen IsA location
  Exit east To hallway.
End The Kitchen.

The hallway IsA location
  Exit west To kitchen.
End The hallway.

Start At kitchen.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a complete Alan adventure (although very primitive). As you see, every Alan construct ends with a period (<code>.</code>) and there is a &#8220;<code>Start At</code>&#8221; sentence at the end, indicating in which location to put the hero when the game starts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type the above text into a text file, e.g. using a notepad program. Run this little Alan source through the Alan compiler and try the adventure (see <a href="#_how_to_use_the_system">Appendix A</a> on how to do this). After starting the adventure, two lines will be shown on your screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock gametranscript">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Kitchen</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line contains &#8220;Kitchen&#8221;, the name of the initial location, and the second a &#8220;&gt;&#8221;, which is the default prompt for the player to input a command. Now try typing &#8220;east&#8221; and press the <kbd>RETURN</kbd>/<kbd>ENTER</kbd> key. The word &#8220;Hallway&#8221; and the prompt will appear. Typing &#8220;west&#8221; will take you back to &#8220;Kitchen&#8221; again. (Use <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd></span> to exit the game if you are running it in a console window.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The identifier for a location is automatically used as a description, a heading, shown when that room is entered. And the words listed in the <code>Exit</code>-parts are translated into directional commands the player can use in his input.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should remember that exits are strictly one-way. An <code>Exit</code> from one location to another does not automatically imply the opposite path. Thus, you must explicitly declare the path back, in the definition of the other location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, just the name of the location is not much of a description. So in order to provide the &#8220;purple prose&#8221; descriptions often found in many adventures there is an optional <code>Description</code>-clause that you can use. Let us describe the Hallway.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The hallway IsA location
  Description
    "In front of you is a long hallway. In one end
     is the front door, in the other a doorway. From
     the smell of things the doorway leads to the
     Kitchen."
  Exit west To kitchen.
End The hallway.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We introduce another feature in this example, namely the text enclosed in double quotation marks (") which is called a <strong>String</strong> or, when used on its own like this, an output statement. When executed this string will be presented to the player and formatted to suit the format of his screen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Invent a description for the Kitchen, enter it in the Alan source and run the changed adventure. You notice, of course, that the text in the output statements is reformatted during output to suit your screen, in order to make room for as much text as possible. Note also that you do not have to worry about this at all&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;in your source file, you may format the text any way you like, even spanning multiple lines with extra white-space included.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This type of output statement is just one of the statements in the Alan Language, and we will see more of them later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also possible to have conditions and statements in the <code>Exit</code>-clauses of a <code>Location</code> to restrict the access to the next location or to describe what happens during this movement.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Exit west To kitchen
  Check kitchen_door Is open
    Else "The door is closed."
  Does
    "As you enter the kitchen the smell of
     something burning is getting stronger."
End Exit west.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_objects">The Objects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another essential feature in Alan are the objects. Like the location, the object is a means to describe the &#8220;physical&#8221; world where your adventure is taking place. Many objects are probably used to provide puzzles, such as closed doors, keys and so on, but other objects should be promoted to objects too. A large number of objects that can be examined and manipulated make a game so much more enjoyable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Objects, like locations, have identifiers and descriptions, so you might guess the general structure of an object:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The door IsA object At hallway
  Is closed.
    Description
    "The door to the kitchen is a sliding door."
    If door Is closed Then
     "It is closed."
    Else
     "It is open."
    End If.
End The door.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An object may initially be located at a particular location. This is indicated by the <code>At</code>-clause, in this case telling us that the door is initially located in the Hallway. Objects do not have to start at a particular place in which case they are not present in the game until located, by executing some code, at some place where the player may lay his hands on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, objects may have attributes indicating the state of certain properties of the object. In this example with a door, the <code>Is closed</code> part indicates that the door should have the attribute closed, which initially is set to <strong>TRUE</strong> (implying that the door is initially closed). The opposite would be indicated with a <code>Not</code>, (i.e. <code>Is Not closed</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, attributes may be numeric (e.g. <code>Has weight 5</code>) or be of string type (e.g. <code>Has inscription "Kilroy was here"</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also introduce another Alan statement, the <code>If</code>-statement. The <code>If</code>-statement allows you to select which statements to execute according to some condition. In the example, the <code>closed</code> attribute of the door selects which description to show. There are further variations of expressions and the <code>If</code>-statement, but we will come back to these later (<a href="#_expressions">Sect. 3.20</a> and <a href="#_if_statement">Sect. 3.17.6.1</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, let&#8217;s look at some other statements in relation to objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It must of course be possible to change the value of attributes of an object. You can do this using the <code>Make</code> statement or the <code>Set</code> statement. For example if the door should be opened (the player having said &#8220;open door&#8221;, perhaps) this could be performed by stating</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Make door Not closed.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To close it (i.e. setting the closed attribute to TRUE again) you write</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Make door closed.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Make</code> statement changes Boolean (or True/False) attributes. The <code>Set</code> statement changes numeric or string attributes, for example</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Set level Of bottle To 4.</code></pre>

<p>These statements only change attributes. The implications of such a change must be implemented by writing Alan code that test these attributes and provides differing text output to the player. This is what gives the player <em>the illusion</em> of a door being open or closed for example.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, attributes are not only available on objects, but on locations and other types of entities also.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another manipulation statement is the <code>Locate</code> statement. This is the statement to use when moving objects from one location to another.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actors can be used to populate the adventure with creatures, beings and other people. They might be pirates or monsters, but the thing they have in common is that they move around or at least perform various actions more or less in the same way as the player does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An actor may have a <code>Description</code> and attributes like objects and locations. An actor performs his movements by following scripts, each having a number of steps. Each step corresponds to one player move.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_inheritance_and_object_orientation">Inheritance and Object Orientation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Object orientation is a term that is often used when talking about programming. The concept is modelled after a natural phenomenon first described by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (or Carl von Linné). He devised a naming system for flowers and plants that was based on features common between various species and families. The idea is that a general concept such as a mammal is defined by listing some features which all mammals share. Specialisations such as sub-species in turn have other, more specialised, features in common.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In nature, we talk about species and individuals. In object oriented programming we talk about classes and instances, which are similar. Classes are abstract definitions of what the common features are and instances are individuals (data objects) having those features.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_inheritance_and_instances">Inheritance and Instances</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inheritance means that a more general class can be restricted or specialised into new sub-classes. We say that the specialised class inherits from the more general. Most object oriented programming languages allows creating instances from any class, which does not happen in nature, there are no individuals that are mammals, they are individuals of some specific species of horse for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In programming, we can use this concept to make some things easier for ourselves. By collecting features that are common to many types of data objects into classes and sub-classes we can inherit those features. In this way, we can avoid explicitly, and repeatedly, stating those for every data object. One small drawback is that we have an implicit declaration of features, which can make reading a bit more obscure. We need to look up the parent class (or classes) for complete information about the object.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_polymorphism">Polymorphism</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By using inheritance, we can also guarantee the properties of similar, or related, instances. If every mammal is a vertebrae, we know that all properties of vertebrates also applies to mammals. We can use this knowledge to handle commonalities without knowing anything about the more specialized kinds, or classes. One example of this might be lockable things like doors and drawers. If they inherit from a common ancestor 'lockable_things', then we do not need know if it was a door or a drawer, if we are only interested in the 'locked' property. This flexibility, know as polymorphism, is possible in programming only through object orientation and inheritance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_every_and_the">Every and The</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan language supports object orientation and inheritance with two constructs:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every mammal IsA vertebrate ...

The house_pet IsA cat ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Every</code>-construct defines a class and its properties, including inheriting from another, even more general class. The <code>The</code>-construct declares an instance, which in this example inherits from the class &#8216;cat&#8217;. The <code>IsA</code>-construct defines from which class properties are inherited.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_pre_defined_classes">The Pre-defined Classes</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make it easy to get started there are eight classes pre-defined in the Alan language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They are <strong>entity</strong>, <strong>thing</strong>, <strong>location</strong>, <strong>actor</strong>, <strong>object</strong>, <strong>literal</strong>, <strong>string</strong> and <strong>integer</strong> and have the relationship, inheritance tree, shown in <em>Figure 2</em> above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The semantics of these pre-defined classes are in short:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only locations (instances inheriting from <code>location</code>) can be visited by the hero (the players alter ego)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only actors may have scripts that they perform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only things will be described automatically when encountered</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Literal and its sub-classes cannot be sub-classed. They are used to handle integers and strings in player input</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the subsections of <a href="#_instances">Instances</a> for more detailed descriptions.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_creating_classes_and_instances">Creating Classes and Instances</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the sections above about locations, objects and actors the examples show how to create an instance of a class. Those examples show how to do it from the pre-defined classes. However, it is the identical if you have defined the class yourself. In general the format is</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The _&lt;instance_ _identifier&gt;_ IsA _&lt;class identifier&gt;_ ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To define a class you do much what you would expect:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every _&lt;class identifier&gt;_ ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this, declarations of all the properties for that class follow. This could include inheriting from another class, e.g.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every door IsA object
End Every.

Every openable_door IsA door
  Is open.
End Every.

The kitchen_door IsA openable_door
End The kitchen_door.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the <code>kitchen_door</code> has the attribute <code>open</code> although it does not specifically show in the declaration. It is initially set to true as specified in the declaration of the class <code>openable_door</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_specialising_and_overriding">Specialising and Overriding</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sub-classing, or specialisation, is usually used to add properties and thus make the instances of the sub-class more restricted, or specialised. In the example above, <code>openable_door</code>s are specialisations of <code>door</code>s since they have an attribute that the more general class does not have.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, a sub-class can also redefine a feature. In the example above a class named <code>closed_openable_door</code> could be defined as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every closed_openable_door IsA openable_door
  Is Not open.
End Every.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes all instances of the new class have the same attribute but it is set to false instead. The important thing is that the feature of having the attribute is common to all <code>openable_door</code>s. This is called overriding a property.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This concludes this short description of object orientation and how the Alan language supports it. In the following descriptions, you just need to remember that most features can be inherited along the inheritance tree and be overridden, both during that inheritance and explicitly in the instance declaration itself.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_containment_classes_and_transitivity">Containment, Classes and Transitivity</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One basic property of instances is that they may contain other instances. Although conceptually simple there are twists that you should know about.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_containers_containing_containers">Containers Containing Containers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Containers might contain other instances that are in turn containers and so on, of course. If you want to consider everything inside a container recursively, you might actually get types of instances you did not expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider e.g. a container, <em>cont</em>, that takes a subclass of <em>object</em><strong>,</strong> <em>subobject</em>. Assume there is also an instance of that class, <em>inst</em>, that also is a container, but takes <em>object</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every subobject IsA object
End Every subobject.

The cont IsA object
  Container Taking subobject.
End The cont.

The inst IsA subobject
  Container Taking object.
End The inst.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you search, recursively, for instances in the container <em>cont</em>, you might then get instances that are both of class <em>subobject</em> and <em>object</em>, e.g. if the <em>inst</em> is inside the <em>cont</em> and in turn contains something, which would then be of class <em>object</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might lead to, completely correct, but surprising, error messages from the compiler indicating that an attribute or other property that you though existed is not available. Especially surprising is perhaps the case where the classes are not even decendants of each other. In this case the contained instances can only be guaranteed to be their common parent, which might be a quite general class like <em>thing</em> or even <em>entity</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_transitivity">Transitivity</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For many scenarios the above works well, and as expected. But for other cases the notion of transitivity is introduced. Transitivity describes how e.g. containment should be interpreted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scenario above may be described as &#8220;transitive containment&#8221; meaning that something is in a container if it is in that container or in any container it contains, recursively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two other types, namely DIRECT and INDIRECT transitivity. Direct transitivity actually means no transitivity. If you investigate a container with direct transitivity you will only get the direct content of it, not the content of the containers within it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, indirect transitivity means instances indirectly contained by a container. In a way it is the opposite of direct transitivity, all instances recursively contained <em>except</em> the directly contained. Here&#8217;s a rule to remember:</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Tip</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transitive = Direct + Indirect</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What this means is that if you use transitive containment you get the same instances that direct <em>and</em> indirect will give you. And it is usually the indirect ones that you should look out for.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_verb_construct">The Verb Construct</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Verb</code> is the construct that implements the effects of an action requested by the player. Verbs are associated with a class or an instance. We will look at the implications of various combinations of these in the next few sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To implement a <code>Verb</code> you need a name for it (which is also the default word the player should input to request that action). You must also decide which effects this verb should have under various circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we want to implement the <code>Verb</code> open for the door we could use the following code</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Verb open
  Does
    Make door open.
End Verb open.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code>Verb</code> is either a simple command taking no parameters, like &#8216;look&#8217;, &#8216;save&#8217; or &#8216;help&#8217;, or it involves one or more parameters that the player can reference. Simple verbs should be declared at the top level, globally, i.e. outside of any other declaration. Verbs taking parameters, on the other hand, must be declared within the class or instance, with which it is associated. For example, if a verb will handle objects it should be declared in the object class. The example above should probably best be placed in the door object itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The kitchen_door IsA object
  Verb open
    Does
      Make kitchen_door open.
  End Verb open.
End The kitchen_door.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This defines the effects of applying the <code>open</code> verb to that precise door. The implementation makes direct references to the <code>kitchen_door</code>, so to make the verb more general it should be possible to apply to all doors.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every door IsA object
  Verb open
    Does
      Make This open.
  End Verb open.
End Every door.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this definition it is possible to apply the verb to all doors. Instead need to reference the object the player mentioned in his command (see <a href="#_the_syntax">Sect. 2.4.8</a> and <a href="#_syntax_definitions">Sect. 3.9</a> for a more thorough discussion). In this case, the attribute <code>closed</code> must also be available for all objects by ensuring that the attribute exists in to the class. (See <a href="#_additions">Sect. 3.8</a> on how to add an attribute to a predefined class such as <code>object</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, there are often also conditions that need to be checked before we can execute this code (perhaps to see if it was possible to open the object!). Therefore, <code>Verb</code>s may have <code>Check</code>s, as we will see next.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_checking_things">Checking Things</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to assert that the correct conditions are fulfilled before the body of a <code>Verb</code> is actually executed the verb may have an optional <code>Check</code> part.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Verb open
  Check o Is openable
    Else "You can't open the $o."
  Does
    Make o open.
End Verb open.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a more realistic definition of the open <code>Verb</code> than the previous one. It specifies that before the statements after <code>Does</code> are executed, the condition after <code>Check</code> must be checked (which, in this case, checks that the object indicated by the player is really possible to open). If that condition is TRUE then the requirements are fulfilled and the body of the <code>Verb</code> (following the <code>Does</code>) can be executed. If this is not the case the <code>Else</code>-part is executed instead (normally showing some message).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code>Check</code> may have multiple conditions as the following code shows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Verb take
  Check o takeable

    Locate o In hero.
End Verb take.</code></pre>

<h4 id="_the_syntax">The Syntax</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally a verb acts on one object or actor, henceforth called a parameter, referenced by the player in a command. This means that the format of player input normally is something like</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock gametranscript">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt; take vase</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This form, or syntax, is the default form if you don&#8217;t specify anything else. The default syntax might thus be described as</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Syntax +
  ? = ? (parameter)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The question marks are place-holders and should be interpreted as the name of the verb.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to allow different and more complex player input the <code>Syntax</code> construct is supplied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Syntax</code> construct is a way to describe the words and parameters the player may use in order to execute a particular verb (its global and more specialised parts). Below is the syntax for <code>put_in</code>, the verb to put something inside a container.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Syntax
  put_in = 'put' (obj) 'in' (cont).</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This syntax defines the <code>put_in</code> verb to be executed when the player has input the word &#8216;put&#8217; followed by a reference to an object or actor (a parameter named <code>obj</code>), followed by the word <code>in</code> followed by a reference to a second parameter (the container, referred to as <code>cont</code>), as in</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock gametranscript">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt; put the green pearl in the black box</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will bind the parameter <code>obj</code> to the instance that represents the green pearl and the parameter <code>cont</code> will be bound to the black box.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also possible to restrict the types of the parameters:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Syntax
  put_in = 'put' (obj) 'in' (cont)
    Where obj IsA object
      Else "You can't put that into anything."
    And cont IsA Container
      Else "Nothing fits inside that."</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This restricts the parameter <code>obj</code> to being an instance inheriting from the class object (as opposed to an actor for example) and the parameter <code>cont</code> to a container (an instance with the container property).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The parameters are used as normal identifiers in the Alan source code. The parameters can only be referenced if they are defined in the current context, i.e. they can only be used in the various bodies of the verb for which the syntax applies (see also <a href="#_run_time_contexts">Sect. 5.3</a> for a detailed discussion).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Syntax</code> construct allows for more than one parameter, in order to make it possible to define more complex player commands. Therefore, the verb execution order described previously from execution of verbs in one instance must be generalised to verb bodies in all the parameters. In the example above, verb bodies in the objects or actors referenced as <code>obj</code> and <code>cont</code> (the green pearl and the black box) are executed (if the verb is present in their definitions).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_text_output_formatting">Text Output Formatting</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Text output on the screen is caused by what you have written in the Alan source code. However, since text is coming from various places it is not easy or even possible, to anticipate the full context of a particular text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, the Alan system takes care of some specific formatting issues. First, text will always flow neatly inside the window or screen. Lines will be broken automatically without braking in the middle of words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Secondly, a few special cases are also handled automatically:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>After a full stop (period, the character &#8216;.&#8217;), an exclamation (&#8216;!&#8217;) or a question mark (&#8216;?&#8217;) and in the beginning of paragraphs, including location headings, the first character will be guaranteed to be upper case, automatically converted if necessary. This means for example that you don&#8217;t have to consider the case when the name of an object might be printed as the first thing in a sentence. The name will automatically be capitalized. For example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The postmen IsA actor At postoffice ...

<p>This would be the case even if the description of the postmen started with a lower case character.</p>

This rule will make sure that the full stop in the following source is automatically adjacent to the previous text, without the need to suppress spacing.</p>

<h3 id="_strict_and_safe">2.5. Strict and Safe</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan language is strict and type safe. This means that the compiler will attempt to prevent any constructs that might generate a problem for the player, such as assigning values of one type to attributes of another type, accessing properties that are not guaranteed to exist on the instance, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple example is</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">1. Every animal IsA object

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At line 8 we will get an error saying that the <em>house_cat</em> does not have the attribute <em>fur</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if that is true, it&#8217;s a good thing that the compiler caught the error, otherwise the game might try to access that attribute. And blow up in the face of the player.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Can you spot the problem? The <em>house_cat</em> is declared as an <em>object</em>, and not as an <em>animal</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other examples include trying to use a script for an actor (or actor subclass) that does not have one, locating something inside something that is not a container and so on.</p>

<p>A more complicated example is this</p>

<p>On line 14 we will get an error saying that <em>someAttribute</em> is not available since the class <em>f</em> can only be guaranteed to be <em>thing</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Is it? Well, the variable <em>f</em> (in the loop) enumerates all things in the box and since the box takes objects, it is possible that it may contain the cont. And since that takes things, and the <em>In box</em> is transitive (see xxx), <em>f</em> may take on any thing that is contained in the cont too.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of ways to fix this of course:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Language option specifies the language in which the adventure is assumed played, and selects different default message texts. Alan is primarily designed for adventures in the English language, but it is also possible to write adventures in other languages. To make this possible, the default messages output by the interpreter may be generated in different languages. It is completely possible to write in other languages, but then you must customize all the message texts. See <a href="#_run_time_messages">Appendix C</a>, <a href="#_input_response_messages">Sect. C.1</a>, for a complete list of such messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan compiler and interpreter will always allow multinational 8-bit characters as input and the default messages is generated for 8-bit character sets, internally representing national characters according to the ISO multinational character set (ISO8859-1) requiring 8 bits. On output, this is converted to the native character set of the machine (whenever possible). This means that portability between platforms should be good even for text containing multi-national (non-ASCII) characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Width specifies how long the lines the interpreter outputs should be (formatting is automatic!). The Length option will instruct the interpreter to how many lines to show on the screen without any player interaction (<strong>&lt;More&gt;</strong>). These values are only used if the interpreter itself cannot get the actual values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Pack option will cause the compiler to compress the texts to occupy less space. As a bonus, this also makes it impossible for the player to cheat by dumping the adventure code file. As a minor drawback, it does make the execution of the adventure a bit slower (noticeable only on some very old, smaller, computers).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to allow debugging of the generated adventure (see <a href="#_debugging">Sect. 6.14</a>), the debug option must be turned on. This may also be performed using the debug compiler switch (see <a href="#_compiler_switches">Sect. A.2</a>).</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_types">3.3. Types</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan language handles information in bits, values. Each such bit of information, or data, is of a specific type. Alan is a strictly typed language, which means that assignment, comparisons and other statements will require that rules concerning the compatibility between such values are not broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Alan language, you cannot explicitly state the type of a value. Instead, this is inferred from how values are used, e.g. the initial value of an attribute or the restrictions put on a syntax parameter.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_basic_simple_and_compound_types">Basic, Simple and Compound Types</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic types of values available in the Alan language are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Integer – e.g. a simple integer constant, a reference to an integer typed attribute or a numeric expression using any of the mathematical operators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>String – e.g. a string constant or a reference to an attribute typed as a string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boolean (true or false) – comparisons yield Boolean values, Boolean attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two other simple types are available:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instance – a reference to an instance or an attribute typed as a reference attribute that refers to an instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event – a reference to an event or an attribute typed as a reference attribute that refers to an event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one compound type in the Alan language:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Set – an unordered list of values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_instance_type">Instance Type</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every time a reference to an instance is made, it can be considered an expression of instance type. In these cases, the class of the instance also often matters. E.g. assigning a reference attribute can only be made if the new value refers to an instance that belongs to the same class or a subclass of the initial value of that attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some types of expressions return a value referring to an a class or instance in the Alan source. Examples include an identifier bound to a parameter allowing instances and a reference attribute.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_event_type">Event Type</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event is a set of statements that can be scheduled to execute with a specified delay. Each reference to an identifier of an Event is of course of the Event type. Events can be referenced by attributes and any reference to such an attribute is of Event type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Expressions of Event type can be used in <code>Schedule</code> and <code>Cancel</code> statements.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_set_type">Set Type</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Set is a collection of values that may be referenced as a single value, but also investigate, added to and removed from. An example might be a set of cards in a dealt hand, the set of spells that the hero have learned, or the set of numbers guessed so far.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The order of elements in the set is not specified. Each member can only occur once in the same set, but a member can occur in multiple sets. You could for example include one set of numbers (integers) in one set and another set of numbers in another set. It is then possible to investigate the sets and remove all members that are members in both.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Set type is a compound type since it is not complete without a member type. You can only include members in a set if the type compatibility rules allow it. A Set may include members that are instances or integers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the Set includes instances, the subclass compatibility rule applies. All members in the set must inherit from the same class. See the section on type compatibility below.</p>

<h4 id="_type_compatibility">Type Compatibility</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assignment and comparisons between values requires the values to be compatible. The three basic types (integer, string and Boolean) are only compatible with themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Values of the Instance type can be compared without restriction, except that there is no notion of lesser or equal, so only equality can be tested. Assignment can be made if the new value is of the same class, or of a subclass, as the attribute or variable that receives the value. This class is normally inferred from the initial value of the declaration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a reference attribute (an attribute referencing an instance) is inferred to be restricted to instances of the class of its initial value. Any subsequent change of the attribute (setting it to refer to another instance) requires that the new instance be of the same class or a subclass thereof.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These rules ensure that attribute references and other properties are always retained during the execution of the whole game. Thus, it will never cause a run-time error on the player.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_type_requirements">Type Requirements</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some statements require their arguments to be of a specific type. This is enforced by the compiler. The compatibility rules apply here also, given that the required type is given by the statement itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Examples include the conditional <code>If</code> statement that requires a Boolean value (or expression) to test and the <code>Use</code> statement, which requires references to instances that are subclasses of the predefined class <code>actor</code>.</p>

<h3 id="_import">3.4. Import</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The source text for a large adventure might become entangled and complex. A way to break up a large text is to divide it into separate files. Each such file can then be imported into the main source using the <code>import</code> statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ebnf" data-lang="ebnf">import = 'import' quoted_identifier '.'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The quoted identifier is the name of the file to import, see <a href="#_filenames">Sect. 4.5</a>. The <code>import</code> may be placed anywhere in a file where a declaration can occur, and the effect will be the same as if the contents of the named file had been inserted at that position in the file. Imports may be nested, so an imported file may in turn import more files, without limits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An imported file is searched for first in the current directory and then in any of the directories indicated using the <code>import</code> switch as described in <a href="#_compiler_switches"><em>Compiler Switches</em></a>, this search is performed in the same order as the <code>import</code> switches occurred on the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The import statement is the way to use the standard library (or a library of your own design). Place the library files in a directory where the compiler will find them, either in the same directory as your other source files or somewhere else (see <a href="#_compiler_switches">Sect. A.2</a> on how to make the compiler look in more folders than the one the main source file is in). In your source you would refer to the main file of such a library by</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Classes are definitions of templates of instances. That means that a class declaration only describes instances, and does not add anything to your game in itself. Instead, you have to create an instance of the class to make it available in the game (see <a href="#_instances"><em>Instances</em></a> below).</p>

<h4 id="_inheritance">Inheritance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every instance must inherit from a class (see <a href="#_inheritance_and_object_orientation">Sect. 2.4.5</a>). Furthermore, user-defined classes must also inherit from other classes. A class or an instance inheriting from a class will get all properties of that class. All properties explicitly declared in a class or instance inheriting from another class will extend, override or complement those properties as specified in the original, parent, class. This way, you can easily create new classes by extending existing ones.</p>

<h3 id="_instances">3.6. Instances</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important part of an Alan game source is probably the declarations of instances. Instances are the objects, locations, actors and other things that fill your game universe. The player traverses and interacts with these in his quest to negotiating your game.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ebnf" data-lang="ebnf">instance = 'THE' id

           'END' 'THE' [id] ['.']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every instance must inherit from a class (see <a href="#_inheritance"><em>Inheritance</em></a> above) keeping all properties of that class. Each inherited property can be amended or overridden by specifying it in the declaration of the instance, and new attributes, exits and scripts can be added in the same way as in class declaration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Exactly the same rules for declaring properties apply to instances. The only difference is that an instance will actually show up in the game when it is run. Remember also that properties declared in an instance are not common to any other instances (unless the declaration overrode the value of a class property).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instances inheriting, directly or indirectly, from the predefined classes <strong>thing</strong>, <strong>entity</strong>, <strong>object</strong>, <strong>location</strong>, <strong>actor</strong> and <strong>literal,</strong> are subject to special semantics and restrictions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are two examples of instance declarations following the rules above:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In these examples the source lines between <code>The</code> and <code>End The</code> all declare various properties that we will learn more about in <a href="#_properties">Sect. 3.7</a>. The rest of the lines are fairly easy to match up to the rules of the Alan language as described by the earlier box.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All capitalized words in the examples above are keywords in the Alan language (see <a href="#_keywords">Sect. D.2</a> for a complete list), the rest are author defined words or identifiers (with the exception of the bold words object and actor, which are identifiers predefined to be special classes).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_entities">Entities</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The base class <code>entity</code> represents the lowest denominator of all instances. All other pre-defined classes inherit from <code>entity</code>. So adding a property to <code>entity</code> will add it to every instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Entities cannot have an initial location, nor can they be located anywhere. On the other hand, they can be considered to be available everywhere. They are not described when encountered. They can only be shown by explicitly executing a <code>Describe</code> statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, if you want an instance to always be available but invisible, create an instance of <code>entity</code>. It is also possible to create subclasses of <code>entity</code>. Instances of such classes will follow the same rules.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_things">Things</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Thing</code> is a pre-defined subclass of <code>entity</code> that adds the property of having a location.

They will, however not show up in descriptions or listings, but the player can refer to and interact with them. They can be described by explicitly executing a <code>Describe</code> statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating an instance of <code>thing</code> is a good choice if you want an invisible instance that should only be available at particular locations, or under specific <em>*circumstances*</em>.</p>

<h4 id="_actors">Actors</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The predefined class <code>actor</code> is intended for providing so called NPC:s, non-player characters, in your game. Like the player, they can move around but to do this they have to be scripted, i.e. programmed with some behaviour using scripts.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An instance inheriting from the <code>actor</code> class will be described when encountered. Actors can be located, as can any <code>thing</code>, but not be inside a container. In addition, they can have scripts.</p>

<p>Actors also exhibit special behaviour when they are described, e.g. when they are encountered. If an actor is executing a script with a description, (see <a href="#_scripts"><em>Scripts</em></a>) this description will be used instead of the one declared in the description clause.</p>

<p>There is one very special actor, the hero, which represents the player. This actor is always pre-declared with some basic properties, so you don&#8217;t have to declare it. But if necessary, it may be re-declared in the same way as any other actor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One situation when this is required is if you need attributes on the hero, such as &#8220;sleepy&#8221; or &#8220;hungry&#8221;. A declaration like the following can then be used:</p>

End The hero.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>The hero is predefined with a simple container property taking objects with no limits. It seems natural to use that as the &#8220;inventory&#8221; of the player, the storage for everything the player is picking up and carrying around. You will probably need to handle carried items in some manner, and the pre-declared container is one suggestion. You can also redeclare the container property of the hero so that it suits your needs.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_locations">Locations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A location is a declaration of a place (a &#8220;room&#8221;) in the game that (normally) can be visited by the player, and have objects lying around, etc. In fact, the map of your game is a set of interconnected locations. A location is any instance inheriting directly or indirectly from the predefined class <code>location</code>. Inheriting from <code>location</code> implies the following semantic properties:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>only locations can be visited by the player</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only locations may have the <code>Entered</code>-clause</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>things and locations may be located to locations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exits can only lead to locations and only locations can have exits</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the start location must be a location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>locations can&#8217;t have container properties</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>verbs in locations are executed only when the hero is at that location</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a location is described (for example when entering it) it is presented with a heading (the location name), the description (in the description clause) followed by descriptions of any present objects and actors not already, explicitly, described (using a <code>describe</code> statement) in the description.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interesting property of locations is that a location can be located at another, both initially and during run-time. The result of having such nested locations is that all things present at the &#8220;outer&#8221; location are also present in the inner. This can be used in multiple levels to allow access to sky, ground and other scenery items available at many locations at once. It can also be used for grouping locations into sets of similar locations and for implementing vehicles.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_names">Names</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, the identifier (&#8220;author name&#8221;) for an instance is also the name shown to the player, and by which he will be able to refer to it. Normally you would want to override this with more elaborate and alternative names. You can do that using the <code>Name</code> clause.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ebnf" data-lang="ebnf">name = 'NAME' id {id} ['.']</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Name</code> clause consists of a list of identifiers optionally followed by a full stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The identifiers given in the <code>Name</code> clause is used when the instance is presented to the player and which the player can use to refer to it. For example</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The south_door IsA object At south_of_house
  Name door
...
The south_of_house IsA location
  Name 'South of House'
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The quoted identifier used in the last example makes the name be one single text string. See <a href="#_words_identifiers_and_names">Sect. 4.2</a> for an explanation of this. This works for locations, which a player usually does not need to refer to, but for things the player should interact with, a more sophisticated mechanism is available.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the name is a sequence of words. The semantics of this declaration is that the word &#8220;chair&#8221; is a noun and &#8220;little&#8221; and &#8220;wooden&#8221; become adjectives. When the player, in a command, want to refer to the object with the author name (identifier) <code>chair3</code>, he may use just &#8220;chair&#8221; if it is the only accessible object with &#8220;chair&#8221; as its noun, or he may distinguish between multiple chairs by also giving one or more adjectives to be more precise about which chair he meant.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to give an instance multiple names by listing a number of name clauses. Each one will define adjectives and a noun as described above. The result is that the player can use any of the names to refer to the object. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The rod IsA object At grate
  Name rusty rod
  Name dynamite

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would allow the player to refer to the object using either &#8216;rusty rod&#8217; or &#8216;dynamite&#8217;. (Or as a side effect &#8216;rusty dynamite&#8217;.) The first name clause is used for building a default description, if necessary (see <a href="#_description">Sect. 3.7.7</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The character case used in any word is retained for output, but player input will always be matched without considering case. This way you can e.g. give capitalized names to people giving a correct output.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_inheriting_names">Inheriting Names</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Names can of course be inherited. This is done in an additive way so that any names inherited are appended to the <code>Name</code> clauses in the declaration. This ensures that the class or instance itself can control the primary name (the first <code>Name</code> clause). In addition, this has the effect that an instance inheriting from a class defining a <code>Name</code> will be possible to refer to also using the inherited name(s). Here is an example with fruits:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every fruit IsA object Name fruit ...
Every apple IsA fruit Name apple ...
Every pear IsA fruit Name pear ...
The gravensteiner IsA apple ...
The macintosh IsA apple ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, both the pear and the apple would be possible to refer to using the word &#8220;fruit&#8221;. Both the gravensteiner and the macintosh would be apples, not only by name, but also by all other properties of apples.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_displaying_instances">Displaying Instances</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an instance is to be shown to the player, it must be displayed in form of text. An instance can be printed in several different ways, it can be described or only mentioned. A description of an instance is a complete and usually more elaborate description of it (see <a href="#_description">Sect. 3.7.7</a>). However, often an instance must be mentioned as a part of a sentence, or in a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such a mentioning of an instance will involve the articles, the name and possibly the <code>Mentioned</code> clause.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basis for this mechanism is the short form, which by default is the first of the <code>Name</code>s. It will, however, be overridden by any existing <code>Mentioned</code> clause (see <a href="#_mentioned">Sect. 3.7.8.4</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The short form can be automatically transformed to a description (for instances that have no <code>Description</code>) by inserting the article (see <a href="#_articles_and_forms">Sect. 3.7.8</a>) and the short form in a default message. In the following example, output of the article is underlined and the short forms are emphasised, the rest is the default message templates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a <em>little black book</em>, a <em>green pearl</em> and an <em>owl</em> here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interpreter also uses this principle when constructing lists of instances in container content lists (as the result of the execution of an implicit or explicit <code>List</code> statement, see <a href="#_list_statement">Sect. 3.17.1.5</a>).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pronouns">Pronouns</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In player input, it is often handy and natural to refer to items using pronouns, such as &#8220;it&#8221;, &#8220;them&#8221; or &#8220;her&#8221;. Alan provides a means to define with which pronouns each instance can be associated.</p>

<p>An attribute is a labelled value that instances have. The declarations of attributes are placed inside a class definition (in which case it will apply to all instances of that class or instances of any sub-class of it) or inside an instance declaration (in which case only this instance will have it, unless it overrode an already inherited attribute with new values). An attribute declaration, or a set of declarations, is introduced using one of the keywords:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<p>An attribute can be of Boolean (having truth values), numeric, string, event, instance or set type. The type of an attribute is automatically inferred from the type of its initial value.</p>

<p>In this example, the reference attribute <code>otherside</code> is introduced in the class <code>door</code>. Its initial value is referring to the class <code>door</code>. This makes the attribute refer to doors. In the subclass <code>lockable_door</code> the attribute is used with another initial value, here it refers to a subclass of <code>door</code>. Despite this, the attribute in the two door instances will allow reference to doors, as indicated by the first declaration (in the class <code>door</code>).</p>

<p>If an instance has a <code>Definite</code> (<code>Indefinite</code> or <code>Negative</code>) <code>Form</code>, either through declaration or inheritance, the printing of its definite, indefinite or negative form will be by executing the corresponding statements only; no article declaration is involved. In this way, the author gets complete control over the spelling and inflection of the instance name in definite, indefinite or negative forms. Some human languages will probably require more use of the <code>Form</code> form (like Swedish), and some less (like English). The forms are particularly useful if the natural language used, have different forms of the noun itself in definite an indefinite forms. An example is the Nordic languages, which use definite suffixes instead of articles.</p>

<p>By default, containers expose their content, but by placing the keyword <code>Opaque</code> in the container declaration, you indicate that this container declaration will initially prohibit access to the contained instances.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The extract clause, including optional <code>Check</code> and <code>Does</code> clauses, allows prohibiting the extraction of the item from the container depending on some condition. If the <code>Check</code> is present, it works the same way as for <code>Verb</code>s (see <a href="#_verb_checks">Sect. 3.10.3</a>). I.e. a <code>Check</code> without a guard expression will unconditionally prohibit extractions; a <code>Check</code> with an expression will evaluate that expression and, if false, execute its <code>Else</code> clause, and then abort the move. The <code>Does</code> clause will be executed if the optional <code>Check</code> passes, or there was no <code>Check</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <code>Extract</code> clause without a <code>Check</code>, but with a <code>Does</code>-clause, executes the Does-clause and then allows the extraction to take place. So, in a way, Checks, if triggered, prevents the extraction, and the <code>Does</code>-clause amends to it, being an extensions of the normal case, much like the <code>Check</code> and <code>Does</code>-clauses for Verbs (see <a href="#_verbs">Sect. 3.7.10</a>). The second form of the clause, with just the statements, is equivalent to an <code>Extract</code> with only a <code>Does</code>-clause.</p>

<p>Using this construct, you can add any property to a class without having access to its declaration.

<p>To determine if the action is possible to carry out, the <code>Check</code>s are executed. Which checks to run, is determined by the class of the instances bound by the parameters to the verb.

<p>If any check should fail, the execution of the current verb is interrupted and the statements following the failing check are executed. The user (player) is then prompted for another command.

Then, the verb bodies in the parameters (in the order they appeared in the syntax definition) on which the verb was applied are examined to find and execute their verb definitions.

<h5 id="_controlling_execution_with_qualifiers">Controlling Execution with Qualifiers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are cases where you don&#8217;t want all the bodies to be executed, or there is a special need to execute them in a different order. The most common case is to prohibit other bodies to be executed, e.g. a verb body in a location might want to stop the player from throwing any object. This verb body must then ensure that it is the only verb bodies to be executed. This can be done using the <code>Only</code> qualifier (see <a href="#_verb_qualification">Sect. 3.10.6</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Qualifiers control the order of execution of verb bodies. How does this work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, starting at the &#8220;innermost&#8221; according to the table above, the verb in the last parameter (if any) is investigated and, if any of its (inherited) verb bodies have the <code>Before</code> or <code>Only</code> qualifier it is executed. If the qualifier was <code>Only</code> the execution is also aborted at this stage and no more verb definitions are examined, otherwise the other parameters are examined in the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the next step, the current location is examined and, if it contains (or inherits) a verb definition with a <code>Before</code> or <code>Only</code> qualifier, that definition is now executed (and if the qualifier was <code>Only</code>, execution is aborted). Since locations can be nested, the surrounding locations are then examined in the same way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a result of this behaviour, a <code>Before</code> qualifier in the verb definition in an object parameter will supersede an <code>Only</code> qualifier in the location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this stage, all <code>Before</code> and <code>Only</code> qualifiers are handled appropriately. This only leaves the definitions without any qualifier or with the <code>After</code> qualifier. The outermost verb body (as indicated in the table above) is examined and if it did not have the <code>After</code> specification, it is executed (if it had an <code>Only</code> qualifier execution is stopped after executing it). Any definition of the verb in the current location is again examined and, if it did not have the <code>After</code> qualifier, it is executed. What remains is to execute the verb definition in the parameters if they have not been executed already, and to execute the location definition if they where declared with the <code>After</code> qualifier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So in short (with base class definitions of the outermost location being the outermost and the instance bound to the last syntax parameter the innermost):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>From the outside in, find any <code>Before</code> or <code>Only</code> definitions and execute them (stop if <code>Only</code> found).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the inside out, execute any definitions not already executed and not declared with the <code>After</code> qualifier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the remaining verb definitions (those with an <code>After</code> qualifier) from the outside in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second item in the above list is equivalent to the normal order of execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The qualifiers are a powerful but confusing concept. The normal order of execution is usually appropriate and only in special cases should qualifiers be used. When they are needed, you will find that one qualifier at the correct definition will normally do the trick. The above algorithm is used to get a strict definition of the execution order. It is not expected that all this complex behaviour will be needed in practice.</p>

<div class="listingblock">

           {statement}
       ['END' 'WHEN' '.' ]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A rule is an arbitrary expression, which, when true, results in the execution of some given statements. Rules can only be declared on the global level (not inside classes or instances). The main intended use of rules is to detect particular situations and then trigger some action. Typically they can be used to make things happen when certain situations arise, such as starting an actor when the hero enters the cave.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example that investigates if the hero is in the cave and if so, activates the monster:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">When hero At cave And monster Not active Then
  Use Script hunting For monster.
End When.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expression that is tested may of course have any level of complexity:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>When hero At cave
  And (monster Is hungry Or monster Is angry)
  And sword Not In hero
=&gt;
  Use Script eat_hero For monster.
End When.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each actor action and event execution is considered atomic (it can&#8217;t be divided into smaller parts). All rule conditionals are evaluated after each actor (including the player) has acted (script step and player command respectively) and after each event has executed. In effect this will mean that a change in state will be detected almost immediately, if there is a rule for detecting that change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The statements within the rule are triggered when the condition <em>becomes</em> true. In the first example, this means that if the monster is not active, the statements will be executed when the hero enters the cave ('hero At cave' becomes true). A rule body can never be executed twice in succession unless the conditional has been evaluated to false in between. In the example above, the triggering of the hunting script for the monster will not happen again unless either the hero has left the cave and entered it again, or the monster has been active and then become not active again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of parameters, <code>Current Actor</code>, <code>Current Location</code>, <code>Here</code> and <code>Nearby</code> is not allowed in rules conditionals or bodies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rules are executed at no location. Therefore it is not possible to communicate directly with the player in the rule with output statements (since the hero cannot be where the rule is executing, see <a href="#_output_statements">Sect. 3.17.1</a>). Triggering an event that handles the output intended for the player, is the recommended solution to this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following is a complete game using a rule:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The kitchen IsA location
  Exit x To kitchen.
End The kitchen.

When Count IsA actor, At kitchen = 1
  Then Schedule whee At actor After 0.
End When.

Event whee
  "Whee!"
End Event.

Start At kitchen.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example the rule conditional (the text marked with grey) is using an aggregation (<code>count</code>, see <a href="#_aggregates">Sect. 3.20.13</a>) over two filters (see <a href="#_filters">Sect. 3.21</a>) that will count the number of actors at the kitchen, and when that number becomes one, the rule will trigger and execute the statements, in this case scheduling an event that handles the presentation of the output to the player.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, remember that rules are checked after each actor has moved. What happens if there are more actors in play and they move in and out of the kitchen, is left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The word on the right hand side of the equal sign must be a word defined elsewhere in the adventure source, such as (part of) an instance name (a noun or adjective), a direction or a verb. The list of words on the left-hand side contains new words (<em>not</em> defined elsewhere) that always will be interpreted as being replaced by the word on the right in the player input.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Synonyms are player words that can be interchanged. Defining synonyms for verb names will not always give you the result that you expect. The following example is incorrect.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Synonyms
  'examine' = look_at.
Syntax
  look_at = 'look' 'at' (obj).
Verb look_at ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will result in an error message indicating that the synonym word <code>look_at</code> is not defined. This is because the <code>Syntax</code> (see <a href="#_additions">Sect. 3.8</a>) defined the verb <code>look_at</code> to have the specified syntax (including the player words &#8216;look&#8217; and &#8216;at&#8217;), the player word <code>look_at</code> is not defined, which is as well as the player would not be able to input a word with an underscore (see <a href="#_player_input">Sect. 5.2</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can achieve the desired effect by instead giving multiple verb identifiers in the verb declarations; this will give the same verb bodies (checks and actions) to multiple verbs. See <a href="#_verbs">the section on <em>Verbs</em></a> for details on verb declarations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also possible to define multiple names for an instance to achieve other effects similar to synonyms. See <a href="#_names">Sect. 3.7.3</a> for a description of this.</p>

<h3 id="_statements">3.17. Statements</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_output_statements">Output Statements</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are various ways to present output to the player, string output, descriptions, printing expressions, listing container content and showing pictures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interpreter intersperses your output with spaces whenever needed. This might for example occur between two output strings:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">"There is a door into the kitchen."
If kitchenDoor Is open Then
  "It is open."
End If.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If handled simple-mindedly the two texts would be adjoined and you as an author would need to cater for this. Instead Alan realizes that a space is required between them. This space is automatically inserted by the interpreter during game play. This is also the case if the output from a <code>Say</code> statement is followed by an output string.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">"Your wristwatch shows" Say hours Of watch.
". Time to go."</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, as in this example, this is not always the intended output. Particularly, if the <code>Say</code> statement terminated the previous sentence, as in the example, we want the full stop to be placed immediately after the output. So, the Alan interpreter will leave out the space between two outputs if the second starts with a period (full stop) followed by a space, or is the single character in the string. This special handling also applies to strings starting with a comma.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whenever an output statement is executed, the result will be printed on the players terminal with the following important exception: if an output statement is executed at a location in the game where the hero not presently is, the output will not be shown. This important feature will relieve the author from the burden of constantly considering what the player will see. It can be used in the following way:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">"Charlie Chaplin leaves the house through the front door."
Locate charlie_chaplin At outside_house.
"Charlie Chaplin comes out from the nearest house."</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the hero is inside the house or out in the street, he will get different views of the situation. This feature ensures that the player only sees what is going on at the current location, and allows for easy adaptation to various viewpoints on the events without the need for any special tests. But see <a href="#_distant_events"><em>Distant Events</em></a> for a solution in the case the hero need to be informed about things happening where he isn&#8217;t.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Locate</code> statement is a way of transferring instances to new locations. When executed, the indicated instance will be placed at the location given. For a description on how to specify where, see <a href="#_where_specifications">Sect. 3.18</a>. When an actor is located at a new location the <code>DOES</code> clause of that location is always executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One special case of the <code>Locate</code> statement is when the predefined actor <code>hero</code> is located somewhere. This is analogous to the player typing a direction, i.e. the hero will be located at the appropriate location. Under particular circumstances, you may want to locate the player at a different location as a side effect of another action. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Event explosion
  "Suddenly the door seems to bulge outwards, it bursts
   open throwing rocks and splinters everywhere. The
   impact of the explosion literally throws you back
   out in the hallway."
  Locate hero At hallway.
End Event explosion.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, the new location will be described and the <code>Does</code> clause of that location executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another special case is when locating something inside a container. The <code>Locate</code> statement will then cause the execution of the limits of that container, and if any of the limits are exceeded the complete player turn is aborted immediately, resulting in no more statements being executed. So, if a player command should result in the location of an object inside a container, a good thing is to place the <code>Locate</code> statement as early as possible, as this enforces the limit checks in the beginning of this player turn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very special third case is locating a location at another location. Locations can in this way be nested, resulting in an outer location working as a region or surrounding for the inner location. The effect of this is that any instances present in the outer location are reachable from the inner.</p>

<p>The meaning of the different constructs is as follows</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Here</code> is the location where the current activity is performed. Often this means where the hero is, but if the expression is evaluated in another run-time context this context is used. See <a href="#_run_time_contexts"><em>Run-time Contexts</em></a> for a detailed discussion, but examples include an event scheduled at a particular location, in which case that location is <code>Here</code>. Note that <code>Here</code> is equivalent to <code>At Current Location</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Nearby</code> means at any adjacent location. An adjacent location means that there exists an exit from the other location to <code>Here</code> (note that the direction is from <code>Nearby</code> to <code>Here</code>). It is allowed to refer to any instance using an identifier or expression. In particular, instances inheriting from <code>location</code> are allowed, which can be used to see if someone at that location can use an exit to get here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Near what</code> has a similar meaning to <code>Nearby</code> except that it refers to some other instance (the what) instead of the current location. The results is a truth value indicating if that other instance is at a location which is nearby (has an exit to) that of the location of the first instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>At what</code> means at the location of the instance referenced by the <code>what</code> specification (see <a href="#_what_specifications">Sect. 3.19</a>). Note that an instance is always <code>At</code> itself, i.e. <code>x At x</code> is always true. This can come as a surprise, especially if you try to aggregate or loop over instances. (See <a href="#_aggregates"><em>Aggregates</em></a> and <a href="#_repetition_statements"><em>Repetition Statements</em></a>.)</p>

<li>
<p><code>This</code> refers to the instance in which code, such as a verb body or a script, is run.

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_types_of_expressions">Types of Expressions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Expressions are used e.g. in <code>If</code> and <code>Set</code> statements. The <code>If</code> statement requires a Boolean expression, i.e. an expression yielding a true or false value, while the <code>Set</code> statement can handle all other types of values.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default behaviour of a <code>Where</code> expression is to evaluate recursively through containers, e.g. if the bottle was inside a bag which was in the inventory, the first expression above would still be true. This implicitly transitive evaluation can also be made explicit through the use of the keyword <code>Indirectly</code>. This would result in exactly the same semantics, but it is explicitly expressed, which can be useful.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, another qualifying keyword, <code>Directly</code>, can be used to indicate that the expression should <em>not</em> evaluate recursively into containers. To test if an instance is at a particular location but not in a container at that location you can use:</p>

<p>The qualifying keyword <code>Directly</code> works in the same way with all <code>Where</code> expressions.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aggregates are functions to calculate values from sets of instances. There are four aggregates available, <code>Count</code>, <code>Sum</code>, <code>Min</code> and <code>Max</code>. Aggregates work by inspecting all instances available, applying the filters, which may remove some, or even all, from the set of instances, and then calculate the value from the remaining instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use filters to filter out instances belonging to a particular class, at a particular location or having a particular Boolean attribute. See <a href="#_filters">Sect. 3.21</a> for an explanation of filters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Count</code> counts the number of instances in the set, e.g.</p>
</div>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">"You are carrying"
Say Count IsA object, In inventory, Is big.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example there are three filters applied, <code>IsA object</code>, <code>In inventory</code> and <code>Is big</code>. All of these filters must pass before an instance is counted. The result of that count is an integer, which is then printed using the <code>Say</code> statement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Sum</code>, <code>Min</code> and <code>Max</code> aggregates return the sum, minimum and maximum value respectively, of an attribute of all instances in the filtered set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any attribute referred to either in the aggregation itself or in the filters, must be an attribute of some class in order to ensure that the attribute is available for all instances. You must ensure this by filtering out only instances of the relevant class, e.g. objects, using a class filter.</p>

<p>Filters can be used to filter out only particular instances to loop or aggregate over.

In particular this is required if any of the other filters refer to attributes, which is only allowed if the class is known and that class is guaranteed to have that attribute. Other ways to restrict the filtered instances is to use a <code>Where</code> filter which implicitly restricts to instances available at or in that location, container or set. See <a href="#_the_whereabouts_of_an_entity">Sect. 3.20.12</a> for details on the various forms of the <code>Where</code> expression.</p>

<p>Multiple filters can be listed separated with a comma. Each filter must enumerate the set of values to a compatible set, e.g. using two <code>IsA</code> filters for actors and locations respectively is not allowed since those two sets can never be compatible.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player controls the execution of an Alan adventure. Each of his inputs are taken care of and acted upon by the run-time system in the interpreter. The execution of an Alan adventure starts by executing the start section. The player is then placed in the location indicated in the start section, the location is described, and the player is prompted for a command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player input is analysed according to the explicit and implicit syntax rules and converted to an execution of verb checks and bodies. Global verb checks and bodies are used for verbs taking no parameters, otherwise the verb bodies are found in the parameter instances or their classes. In case the player typed a directional command the corresponding exit check and code is executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the players command has been taken care of, all rules are evaluated and possibly executed. Then each of the other actors executes one step in their scripts (if active) and for each actor the rules are evaluated again. Finally, each event that is scheduled for this round is fired, and the rules evaluated yet again. Finally the player is prompted for another command.</p>
</div>

<p>So, to summarise:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>get and execute a player command
evaluate all rules
for each actor
  execute one step (if active)
  evaluate all rules as above
end for
for each pending event
  execute it
  evaluate all rules
end for</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A player command may be either a verb or a direction. A verb is executed by checking the syntax of the input, performing any preconditions (checks) and then executing the verb bodies (as described in <a href="#_verbs"><em>Verbs</em></a> and <a href="#_scope"><em>Scope</em></a>). A directional command is executed by finding any exit in that direction, evaluating the checks and the body (if any) of that exit and locating the <em>hero</em> at the new location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the player inputs an empty command, this is equivalent to forfeiting his turn. The empty command will simply be ignored. The events and other actors, including turn counting, then proceeds as if the player had input a proper input, before returning to the player prompt.</p>

<p>A restriction placed on the player input by the interpreter is that the words the player is allowed to use can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores and dash. This must be kept in mind when naming verbs that use the default syntax (an explicit <code>Syntax</code> statement can always specify other player words to trigger the verb).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_run_time_contexts">5.3. Run-time Contexts</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the player enters a command, the Alan run-time system evaluates the various constructs from the adventure description (source) as described above. Depending on the player&#8217;s command evaluation of different parts of the adventure may be triggered. These parts all have different conditions under which they are evaluated and have different contexts. Four different execution contexts can be identified:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Execution of a verb. During the execution of a verb (the syntax and verb checks and the verb bodies), which is the result of the player entering a command that was not a directional command, parameters are defined and may be referenced in the statements and expressions. In addition, the <code>Current Actor</code> is set to the hero and <code>Current Location</code> to the location where the hero is (<code>Here</code> refers to the location of the hero).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution of descriptions. These are started as the response to a directional command, a <code>Look</code> or <code>Describe</code> statement, or a <code>Locate</code> statement operating on the hero. During this, no parameters are defined, <code>Current Actor</code> is set to the hero, and <code>Current Location</code> of course to the location being described. The description clauses for objects and locations, as well as the <code>Entered</code> clause of locations, are evaluated in this context. <code>Entered</code> clauses are executed for all actors entering a location with <code>Current Actor</code> set to the moving actor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution of actors. When an actor performs his script step there are no parameters defined but <code>Current Actor</code> is set to the actor currently executing. <code>Current Location</code> is set to that of the executing actor (<code>Here</code> refers to where the executing actor is).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution of events, no parameters and no actor is defined. The location is set to where the event was scheduled to execute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execution of rules. Rules are executed without location, so neither parameters, <code>Current Location</code> or <code>Current Actor</code> is defined. Any output statement will in this context be completely useless since the hero can never be at the same location as the execution of the rule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, the execution of various parts of the adventure source can also be said to have a number of different focuses, meaning where the action is considered to take place:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The hero&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the actions of the player are always focused on the hero and the actions performed are always related to where the hero is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An actor&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;steps executed by an actor are always focused where the actor is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An event&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;code executed in events are focused where the event was specified to take place</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A rule&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;rules are executed after each actor (including the hero) and after each event with the focus set to the complete game world</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_moving_actors">5.4. Moving Actors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main way to move the hero is through the exits (see <a href="#_exits">Sect. 3.7.12</a>). They are executed if the player inputs a directional command, i.e. a word defined as the name for an exit in any location. First, the current location is investigated for an exit in the indicated direction, if there is none an error message is printed. Otherwise, that exit is examined for <code>Check</code>s, which are run according to normal rules (see <a href="#_verb_checks">Sect. 3.10.3</a>). If there was no <code>Check</code> or if the check passed the statements in the body (the <code>Does</code>-part) is executed. The hero is then located at the location indicated in the exit header, which will result in the description of the location (by executing the <code>Description</code>-clause of the location) and any objects or actors present (by executing their <code>Description</code>s, explicit or implicit).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When any actor (including the hero) is located at a location, the <code>Entered</code> clause of that location is executed as if the actor had moved into that <code>Location</code>. The actor that was moved will be the <code>Current Actor</code> even if the movement was not caused by him (but the result of an event, for example). Therefore, this is also the last step in the sequence of events caused by locating the hero somewhere.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_undoing">5.5. Undoing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A player might occasionally regret a command that he gave, perhaps realising that it was not the correct one. The Alan interpreter supports such undoing of commands. This means that the player can backup commands that (s)he later regretted. The interpreter stores each game state as soon as it has changed and an <code>undo</code> command resets the game state to the last saved one. This works completely automatically and as many states as memory permits is saved, giving almost unlimited <code>undo</code> capability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The player command to restore a previous game state is handled directly by the interpreter. It must consist of the single word <code>undo</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scripting_and_commenting">5.6. Scripting and Commenting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most versions of the Alan interpreter, Arun, supports both taking a transcript of a game in progress and playing it back as input to the interpreter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is very convenient during development of a game where you can play through the game up to a point and start from there, or even automatically test your game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make Arun read input from a script file you can use the special command character &#8216;<code>@</code>&#8217;, which should be followed by the name of the text file in which your commands are listed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can add comments to each line in a script file. The interpreter will not read beyond a semicolon, &#8216;<code>;</code>&#8217;, so anything after it can be seen as a comment. Note that this also works for direct player input.</p>

<h2 id="_hints_and_tips">6. Hints And Tips</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter will give you some ideas about how the various features of Alan may be used to implement common features in an adventure game. These are only suggestions and you are, of course, welcome to invent your own, but these are probably some ideas that can get you started.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the import mechanism of the Alan language (see <a href="#_import">Sect. 3.4</a>) you can reuse snippets that you invent in multiple games or works. By building such a library you don&#8217;t have to reinvent the same thing every time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very easy way to get a lot of functionality, and learn about using the language, is to use the Alan standard library. You you can download it from the Alan Home Pages. It implements many of the things described below, and loads of other handy things for you to use directly. For details on how to use that library, refer to its documentation.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_use_of_attributes">6.1. Use of Attributes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes are primarily used for holding status information about the instance to which it belongs. This allows, for example, a water bottle to contain three levels of water.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The bottle IsA object
  Has level 3.
  Verb drink
    Does
    If level Of bottle &gt; 0 Then
      "You take sip from the bottle."
      Decrease level OF bottle.
    Else
      "There is no more water in the bottle."
    End If.
  End Verb drink.
End The bottle.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example is the broken mirror.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The mirror IsA object
  Is Not broken.
  Verb break
    Does
      Make mirror broken.
  End Verb break.
End The mirror.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The appropriate verbs defined in the instances may then modify the attributes and thus update the status information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes defined for a whole class of instances also allow an extra dimension of classification of the instances. If the following declaration is made</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Add To Every object
  Not takeable.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>then all objects receive the attribute &#8220;takeable&#8221; and unless the attribute is specifically redeclared for a particular instance they will not be take-able. Note however that the semantic meaning (what actually happens, such as preventing the &#8220;taking&#8221;) of &#8220;takeable&#8221; must be implemented e.g. in the verb &#8220;take&#8221;:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Verb take
  Check Object Is takeable
    Else "You can't take the $o."
  Does
    Locate Object In inventory.
End Verb take.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the same way restrictions concerning what is possible to eat, drink, open etc. may be implemented. This use of attributes to classify instances is &#8220;action-oriented&#8221;, i.e. they imply that a particular action (verb) is applicable to the instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An alternate approach is to use attributes to classify instances after their characteristics. Consider:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Verb take
  Check o Is Not heavy
    Else "That is much too heavy."
  And o Is Not animal
    Else "$+1 moves quickly away, just far enough
          for you not to reach it."
  Does
    Locate o In hero.
    "You take" Say The o. "."
End Verb take.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this approach you need to keep track of which properties a particular verb will accept or require. This could be extended one step further, having verbs check actual dimensions, such as weight or size, instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An while we are talking about classification, the Alan 3 class concept can help. Often a classification can be made, clearly and succinctly, by defining a sub-class, for which every property pertaining to that type of instances can be collected. Often, the need for an attribute disappears.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further more, you don&#8217;t need to define a syntax for a single parameter verb if it only accepts instances from a particular class. Consider the following definitions:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Every vehicle IsA object
End Every vehicle.

Every car IsA vehicle
  Verb drive
    Does "Yoooohooooo!"
  End Verb.
End Every car.

Every bus IsA vehicle
End Every bus.

The car1 IsA car At l
End The car1.

The bus1 IsA bus At l
End The bus1.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without any syntax definition what so ever, Alan will supply a default syntax for the drive verb which restricts the use of it to only instances of car:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock gametranscript">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt; look</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a car1 and a bus1 here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt; drive bus1<br>
You can&#8217;t do that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt; drive car1<br>
Yoooohooooo!</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the class mechanism not only allows for another way to classify your instances, but also makes it much easier to get player input handled correctly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_descriptions">6.2. Descriptions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Attributes come in handy when presenting information about instances to the player. The attributes can be tested in <code>If</code>-statements to modify the <code>Description</code>s and possibly even the short description in the <code>Mentioned</code> sections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The mirror IsA object
  Is Not broken.
  Description
    "On the wall there is a beautiful mirror with an
     elaborate golden frame."
    If mirror Is broken Then
      "Some moron has broken the glass in it."
    End If.
  Verb break
    Does
      Make mirror broken.
  End Verb break.
End The mirror.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you also use this feature with the short descriptions will make the adventure feel a bit more consistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The bottle IsA object

      "a bottle of water"
    Else
      "an empty bottle"
    End IF.
End The bottle.</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_common_verbs">6.3. Common Verbs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As your library of adventures grow you will find that some verbs are often needed, and always function the same way. Examples are &#8220;take&#8221;, &#8220;drop&#8221;, &#8220;invent&#8221;, &#8220;look&#8221;, &#8220;quit&#8221; and so on. It is advisable to put them in a file which may then be imported into your games. See <a href="#_import">Sect. 3.4</a> about the import mechanism. The files may then containing these common verbs as well as their syntax definitions and any synonyms. Attributes needed for these particular verbs could also be placed in a default attribute declaration in this file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All your adventures may then import this file (or files), making these features immediately accessible when you start a new adventure. All that this takes is some thought as to what names to use for the attributes as discussed in <a href="#_use_of_attributes">Sect. 6.1</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And of course there is already an extensive library available from the Alan website, <a href="http://www.alanif.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.alanif.se</a>. It also includes a lot of other features common to most adventure games.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_distant_events">6.4. Distant Events</h3>

<p>An effect of the feature that output is not visible unless the hero is present, is that the description of an event might not always be presented to the player.</p>

End Event.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the hero isn&#8217;t at the location where the event is executed, he will never know anything about what has happened. The solution is to create an event that goes of where the hero is.</p>

<h3 id="_doors">6.5. Doors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common feature in adventure games is the closed door. Here&#8217;s one way implement it:</p>

  End Exit.
End The treasury.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that we need two doors, one at each location, but they are synchronised by always making them both opened or closed at the same time. The check in the <code>Exit</code>s makes sure that the hero cannot pass through a closed door.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_questions_and_answers">6.6. Questions and Answers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to ask the player for an answer to some question. One example is if you want to confirm an action. The following example delineates one simple way to do this, which could be adopted for various circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The hero IsA actor

        type your next command."
  Make hero quitting.
  Schedule unquit After 1.
End Verb 'quit'.

Verb yes
  Check hero Is quitting
    Else "That does not seem to answer any question."
  Does Quit.
End Verb yes.

Event unquit
  Make hero Not quitting.
End Event unquit.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_actors_2">6.7. Actors</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actors are vital components to make a story dynamic. They move around and act according to their scripts. To make the player aware of the other actor&#8217;s actions they need to be described. This must be done so that the player always get the correct perspective on the actions of the actors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A way to ensure this is to rely on the fact that output statements are not shown unless the hero is at the location where the output is taking place. This means that for every actor action, especially movement, you need to first describe the actions, then let the actor perform them and, finally, possibly describe the effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example is the movement of an actor from one location to another. In this case the step could look something like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">"Charlie Chaplin goes down the stairs to the hallway."
Locate charlie_chaplin At hallway.
"Charlie Chaplin comes down the stairs and
 leaves the house through the front door."
Locate charlie_chaplin At outside_house.
"Charlie Chaplin comes out from the nearest house."</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An actor is described, for example, when a location is entered or as the result of a <strong>Look,</strong> in the same way as objects are. This means that a good idea is to include the description of an actor&#8217;s activities in the description of him. One way to do this would be to use attributes to keep track of the actors state and test these in the description clause.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The george IsA actor
  Name George Formby
  Is
    Not cleaning_windows.
    Not tuning.
  Description
    If george Is cleaning_windows Then
      "George Formby is here cleaning windows."
    ElsIf george Is tuning Then
      "George Formby is tuning his ukelele."
    Else
      "George Formby is here."
    End If.
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although quite feasible, this is a bit tedious. As, at least a part of, the state is indicated by the script the actor is executing, this could be used to avoid the potentially large <code>If</code>-chain. The optional descriptions tied to each script will be executed instead of the main description when the actor is following that script. So this would allow us to simplify to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The george IsA actor
  Name George Formby
  Description
    "George Formby is here."
  Script cleaning.
    Description
      "George Formby is here cleaning windows."
    Step
      ...
  Script tuning.
    Description
      "George Formby is tuning his ukelele."
    Step
      ...
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes it easier to keep track of what an actor is doing. Another hint here is to describe the change in an actor&#8217;s activities at the same time as executing the <code>Use</code> statement, like</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Event start_cleaning<br>
Use Script cleaning For george.<br>
"All of a sudden, George starts to clean the windows."<br>
End Event.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes the descriptions of changes to be shown when it takes place and the description of the actor is always consistent. You can, of course, still have attributes describing the actor&#8217;s state to customize the description of the actor on an even more detailed level, but it generally suffices to describe an actor in terms of what script he is executing.</p>

<h3 id="_vehicles">6.8. Vehicles</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current version of Alan does not support actors being inside containers or inside other actors, which could be a straight forward way to implement vehicles.

<p>You can also see from the code above that there are (at least) two events that need to be defined too. They handle the movement of the car from one place to another:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Event drive_to_parking
  "You drive out from your garage and approach a large
   parking lot."
  Set position Of car To 1.
  Locate car At parking_lot.
  Schedule drive_to_garage After 1.
End Event drive_to_parking.

Event drive_to_garage
  "You drive out from the parking lot and approach your own
   garage."
  Set position Of car To 0.
  Locate car At garage.
  Schedule drive_to_parking After 1.
End Event drive_to_garage.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main idea is that the player/reader is inside the car, and the events are executed at this location thus emulating movement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a multitude of solutions for this problem. One possibility is to exchange the car object for an actor and the events for script steps. However, in this solution the car object is not where the hero is (<code>inside_car</code>) so the output from the scripts for the car will not automatically be shown to the player. There are (at least) two different ways to deal with this (one involving attributes, the other involving an extra object), but the solutions are left as an exercise to the reader!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Alan allows nesting locations (locating a location at another as if it was an object or actor), yet another solution would be to actually move the car location between the garage and the parking lot.</p>

<h3 id="_floating_objects">6.9. Floating Objects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Floating objects is a term used for objects that are available everywhere, or at least at many places. Usually they are available wherever the hero is, and we want to avoid creating duplicate objects, so in a way we make them float along with the hero, or some other actor, instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_body_parts">Body Parts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One example of floating objects is the various parts of the hero&#8217;s body.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create floating objects you can use a particular feature of entities, namely the fact that they are always located where the hero is. Such an entity can of course have the container property to allow it to contain a number of other instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So to have the hero&#8217;s body parts available wherever the hero goes you can use:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The body_parts IsA entity
  Container
End The body_parts.

The right_arm IsA object Name right arm In body_parts ...
The head IsA object Name head In body_parts ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using entity containers is also a simple way to create other compartments on the hero, such as a belt.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The belt IsA entity
  Container
    Header
      If Count In hero &gt; 0 Then "and"
      Else "but" End If.
        "in your belt you have"
      Else
        ""
End The belt.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can combine that with the following definitions of the hero and the 'invent' verb:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The hero IsA actor
  Container
    Header "You are carrying"
    Else "You are empty-handed"
      If Count In belt = 0 Then "." End If.
End The hero.

Verb invent
  Does
    List hero.
    List belt.
End Verb invent.</code></pre>

<h4 id="_outdoors_and_indoors">Outdoors and Indoors</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another example of floating objects are semi-abstract objects like the air, the ground and walls. Some of these also have the extra complexity that they should be available only under certain conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, you would not want outdoor things to be available when you are indoors. To solve this, simply create yet another container object where we can store the outdoor things when they should not be accessible and place it where the hero can never be. Now we only need to make sure that the objects are transferred between the two storages:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to add the boolean attribute <code>outdoors</code> to every location to the make the rules work, of course.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And Voilà, every time the hero arrives at an outdoor location he will find the air and the sky. And every time he enters a location that has the attribute <code>outdoors</code> set to false he will not find them available.</p>

<p>Well, perhaps he would like to have the air available indoors too, but that is left as an exercise for the reader!</p>

<h3 id="_darkness_and_light_sources">6.10. Darkness and Light Sources</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A very common puzzle in old time adventures (so much so that it has possibly been exploited beyond its potential) is the problem of dark locations and finding a source of light.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Darkness and light sources can be implemented in Alan in different ways. Again we basically have the choice between attributes and classes. The solutions are both general and rather similar so we will have a look at the solution using attributes and leave the other solution to the reader. (A good exercise to really understand the Alan class concept, so please take a stab at it. If you want to have a look at one solution, you can study the Alan standard library, which uses classes to implement light sources.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First we need an attribute that all objects have. We know we only need to consider objects because light sources need to be transported by the player, so they can not just be anywhere, like entities.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Add To Every object
  Is
    Not lightsource.
End Add To.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This ensures that all objects have the boolean (true/false valued) attribute <code>lightsource</code> with the default not being a light source. Any object that provides light need to explicitly state that they are instead. For some instances this attribute might change value dynamically, e.g. when the lamp is lit and extinguished.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Locations then must declare themselves as lit or not:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Add To Every location
  Is lit.
End Add To.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we assume most locations are lit, dark locations need to declare themselves <code>Not lit</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can now count the number of instances at the current location having the attribute <code>lightsource</code> set and if there are one or more there is some light provided. So, the <code>look</code> verb could be reworked to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Verb 'look'
  Check Current Location Is lit
    Or Count IsA object, Is lightsource, Here &gt; 0
  Else
    "You cannot see anything without any light."
  Does
    Look.
End Verb.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The check of the <code>look</code> verb now checks the current locations need for light and then counts instances of object, that are light sources and present, to see if there is light.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, we must also modify the dark locations so that they don&#8217;t display their descriptions upon entrance. This is easy to do using another addition to every location, a description check, similar to the check in the <code>look</code> verb:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">Add To Every location
  Description
  Check Current Location Is lit
    Or Count IsA object, Is lightsource, Here &gt; 0

<h3 id="_distant_imaginary_objects">6.11. Distant &amp; Imaginary Objects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes you need to make it possible for the player to refer to things either far away, that are not really objects or that may be at many places at once. Examples of these are a distant mountain that may be examined through a set of binoculars, the melody in &#8220;whistle the melody&#8221;, and water or walls. One way of handling this is to use entities, since they are &#8220;everywhere&#8221;. But sometimes you need better control over when they are available and when not.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_mountain">A Mountain</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For objects that need to be visible from a distance, the easiest method is to introduce a &#8216;shadow object&#8217;. This is a second object acting on behalf of, or representing, the distant object at the locations where it should be possible to refer to it. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The hills IsA location
  :
End The hills.

The mountain IsA object At hills
  :
End The mountain.

The scenic_vista IsA location Name Scenic Vista
End The scenic_vista.

The shadow_mountain IsA object AT scenic_vista
  Name distant mountain
  Description
    "Far in the distance you can see the Pebbly
     Mountain raising towards the sky."
End The shadow_mountain.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would allow for example at scenic_vista:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock gametranscript">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenic Vista.</strong><br>
Far in the distance you can see the Pebbly Mountain raising<br>
towards the sky.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&gt; look at mountain through the binoculars<br>
&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the mountain must be visible and possible to manipulate from a number of locations, you might implement one shadow object for each location, but this might become a bit tedious if they are many. If they are identical you can use a simple rule like the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">When hero At scenic_vista Or hero At hill_road =&gt;
  Locate shadow_mountain At hero.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will ensure that whenever the hero moves to any of the places from where the mountain is visible, the <code>shadow_mountain</code> is sure to follow. However, as the rules are executed <em>after</em> the hero already has moved, a better strategy might be to make the <code>shadow_mountain</code> &#8216;silent&#8217;, i.e. to have no description. Instead, the description of it should then be embedded in the description of the adjacent locations. Yet, another possibility would be to move the pseudo-object around using statements in the exits, like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The scenic_vista IsA location Name Scenic Vista
  Exit east To path
    Does
      Locate shadow_mountain At path.
  End Exit east.
End The scenic_vista.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of which of these strategies you chose, you need to take care that the shadow object is not present when the real object is. In this particular case, it should not be moved to the hills.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_melody">The Melody</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To allow the player to 'whistle the melody' for example, there are two different tactics that can be applied. One choice is to make the melody an <code>entity</code> (or some subclass thereof that you have defined), because, as we have seen, those can be manipulated from everywhere:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The melody IsA entity ...
Syntax 'whistle' = 'whistle' (m) ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other route would be to make it an actual <code>object</code>. In this case the syntax for the whistle verb would need to indicate omnipotence, meaning that the player can refer to instances (even those inheriting from <code>object</code>) to be used as parameters even from afar.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-alan" data-lang="alan">The melody IsA object ...
Syntax 'whistle' = 'whistle' (m)! ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The melody then does not have to be reachable, near or even be at any location at all, for the player to be able to refer to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In both cases you would most likely need to restrict the parameters for the syntax so that the player can&#8217;t 'whistle the chair'. Which of the two strategies you would chose greatly depends on things like:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>are there many things that this applies to (many 'melodies', perhaps)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>should the player be able to manipulate this instance in other ways?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do you need many different entities for various purposes?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="_structure">6.13. Structure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good thing to do when designing an interactive fiction story is to separate the geography from the story. In Alan, you can use the import facility to structure your Alan source. One approach could be to place the description of each location in a separate file together with any objects that could be considered part of the scenery or at least is not only a tool in a puzzle. These files can then be included in a &#8216;map&#8217; file, which in turn is included by the top-level file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The story line can be divided into files too, one for each <code>scene</code>. A scene being comments describing the important things that are suppose to happen, any prerequisites and objects, events, rules etc. which are specific for this part of the story.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This strategy will both give you a better structure of your adventure as well as help you design a better story, much like the storyboarding technique used in making movies or plays.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally your Alan code is flawed and you really can&#8217;t understand what is actually happening. To aid in discovering which part of your code is run when, the interpreter Arun incorporates some features for debugging. There are a few debugging switches available when starting the interpreter from the command line:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>-c       Log the commands input by the player

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_command_logs_and_game_transcripts">Command Logs and Game Transcripts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For various purposes, such as debugging, an actual log of the player commands can be handy. Such a log is created if the option <code>-c</code> is given to the interpreter when starting a game. The log files are created in the directory, which was current when the interpreter was started, the name of the log file will begin with the game name and have the extension <strong>.log</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A command log can on some systems be used as input to the interpreter, and thus automate the execution of the exact player experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can only activate one of the logs in a single session.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_interpreter_and_instruction_trace">Interpreter and Instruction Trace</h4>

<p>Trace mode can also act as an aid in debugging. Level 1 will print information about every invocation of the instruction interpreter, making it easier to see which parts of the code are being executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Trace level 2, single instruction trace, will also trace every single Acode instruction. The Acode is based on a stack machine but single instruction trace will not show all stack operations. Level 3 shows the execution of these also. Level 4 dumps the content of the stack for every instruction.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_debug_mode">Debug mode</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, and usually most useful, there is the debug mode. If the interpreter is started with this option, it will execute the start up sequence and then prompt for a debug command with</p>

Alan allows the source to be separated into multiple files, so the interpreter always indicate which file the source line is in, e.g. when hitting a breakpoint or stepping to the next source line. When setting a breakpoint the current file is always assumed. You can currently set a breakpoint in another source file by preceding the line number with the file name delimited by a colon.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_adventure_construction">7. Adventure Construction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter will give a few clues on how to be a successful adventure author, because creating a <em>good</em> adventure is more like writing a book than writing a program (although Alan can be viewed as a kind of programming language).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_getting_an_idea">7.1. Getting an Idea</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with a book, the success or failure depends on how intriguing the story is, how hooked you can get the reader (in our case the player). Therefore, the first step <em>must</em> be to get a good idea. This may be hard or easy but with time, you, like any good author, learn to pick up ideas when you get them in ordinary every-day life, and store them for later use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A seemingly simple idea might also be developed into a good adventure if it is placed in the correct setting and supplied with additional features, tricks and problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have a good idea, try to refrain from typing it in directly in a text editor and compile it with Alan. Instead, write the story down as if it were the story line for a book or a movie. Where appropriate, insert hints on various diversions and alternate paths that come to mind, but try to stay mainly with the main story from beginning to the preferred end. Then, let a close friend read it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_elaborating_the_story">7.2. Elaborating the Story</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After having rewritten the story line once or twice, start creating the scenery. If your setting is small, you could draw a map of the locations needed, but a better way is probably to make a list of major locations first (those essential to the story). For each location note what important properties the location must have and which objects are necessary (just as notes, <em>don&#8217;t</em> create the Alan declarations yet!). For each object, make a small note on why the object is needed (by the player!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may also be done using a scene-by-scene approach. By this, we mean that the story is segmented into scenes (and maybe also acts) like in a play. For each act and scene, you do the above. This makes it easier to get an overview over a larger adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also suggest that you also create a story on a level above the actual game, at least in your own mind. This story should explain why the game-world exists and thus give a consistency to the text that you will present to the player. Nobody likes an adventure without a cause. This story or world of ideas need not be revealed to the player.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also applies to the narrator, i.e. the imaginary person or creature that carries out the conversation with the player. Create an image of him or it and stick to it. Receiving comments about your (limited) progress in the game might be funny as long as they are not out of character.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_implementing_it">7.3. Implementing it</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At last, it is time to sit down at the terminal. Divide the adventure text into files containing global verbs, the map (possibly divided further according to the scenes), the actors (perhaps one file for each actor) and a main file including the other files. This makes it easy to handle the adventure and you might ask your friend to participate in the development by giving him a few files to work with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, just declare the locations and connect them with exits. Do not work on the &#8220;purple prose&#8221; descriptions yet. The Alan system supplies good defaults for descriptions and so on so use these while developing the structure of the adventure. Do not bother even with the details of making it impossible to pick up the elephant, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Play the adventure continuously during the development, but do not try the things you plan to make impossible later. Just go through it according to the line you planned the story to follow. A hint here is to use a separate file for the start section. In this file you can easily set up the situation you wish to test while not having to tire yourself by playing the adventure from the start every time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_polishing_the_adventure">7.4. Polishing the Adventure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There, now you have a working adventure, it&#8217;s still a bit bare bones, but still the story plays the way you planned. Now it is time to insert all the nice descriptions, the limitations and perhaps the extra things to divert and hinder the hero. Just be careful not to fall into the locked-door-syndrome. Too many adventures have been tedious to play because you need to find-key/get-key/unlock-door- with-key/open-door (anyway, why do people go around locking doors and throwing away the keys). Think big.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Start by fixing the verbs so that they prohibit the impossible. Introduce as many synonyms as you can think of, this makes the adventure so much more playable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create the location descriptions. Remember to use the same style in all your descriptions; breaking out of style does not look good in the eyes of the adventurous. The descriptions must give the player the correct image, the brain is still the best graphic interface available, but they should also plant ideas in the player on how to solve the problems you place before him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing to aim for is the feeling that a player gets when he somehow finds information explaining things he has encountered earlier in the game. Here, as always, it is good advice to ask a friend to read the texts and convey his or her impressions (remember you know it all because you wrote it!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, fill in the adjectives for the objects, their descriptions and short descriptions (if needed).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_beta_testing">7.5. Beta Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you might think that you can start distributing your game. But, wait! As any complex computer program, the game may have various kinds of bugs. Bugs in a work of interactive fiction range from misspellings and grammar errors in your descriptions, logic errors in your implementation of puzzles or events or omissions in the descriptions of surroundings that make the player miss or misunderstand how to act, to inconsistencies in the settings or story, plots that don&#8217;t work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So how do you find these? Your only help are the beta testers. They are the people that you now should consider first a first trial beta release of your game. They should be people who you trust do give their honest opinion and really play it through to find any problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The beta testers will probably give you a long list of issues that you have to address before the next release. Some of the issues are simple; others may affect the basis of your story. You should seriously consider (and if possible discuss) such suggestions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One aid in finding any problems in the playability of the game is to use the log file facility of the interpreter (see the section <a href="#_command_logs_and_game_transcripts"><em>Command Logs and Game Transcripts</em></a>) to produce a list of the commands a player have used. This can greatly aid in spotting troublesome areas in your game. One common such is where the player becomes stuck and reverts to "guess-the-verb". The log will give you the output of the exact game played.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After having collected all this information, considered which ones to act upon, and implemented these, you should probably do it once again (sigh!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, at long last, your adventure game is ready to meet its audience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_how_to_use_the_system">Appendix A: How To Use The System</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How to actually set up and use the complete Alan system depends very much on which platform, OS and in which environment you are going to use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you just want to run a game, there is of course the original command line version distributed from <a href="http://www.alanif.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.alanif.se</a>. To use this, read the relevant sections below to get a feel for how that will work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But there are also a number of other packages that include an Alan interpreter, Gargoyle and Spatterlight, are two, with Gargoyle at the point of writing, being the one most up to date, and also available on multiple platforms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you actually want to write Interactive Fiction using Alan you also need the compiler. This is distributed from <a href="http://www.alanif.se/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.alanif.se</a> in what&#8217;s called the complete packages, including compiler, interpreter, the documentation, a conversion program for v2 games and some examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever option you choose, there should be more detailed instructions on how to install included with that package. Below follows some information pertaining to the original versions from the Alan website.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_compiling">A.1. Compiling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although there are other options, like a prototype AlanIDE, WinAlan et al., basic use of the Alan Adventure Development System is through a traditional command line batch compiler. This means that the actual development system is a compiler that reads text files created using any standard text editor. To compile an adventure use the following command in a command shell:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>alan &lt;adventure&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <code>&lt;adventure&gt;</code> is the name of the main file containing your adventure source text. The compiler will assume an extension of <strong>&#8220;.alan&#8221;</strong> if none is supplied. The option <code>-help</code> will give a brief help on other options to the compiler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary output from the compiler is an adventure code file <strong><em>adventure</em>.a3c</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An identifying file, <strong><em>adventure</em>.ifid</strong>, is also produced. This file contains a unique identification of your game for bibliographical purposes. The content of it will be compiled into the adventure code file, which makes your game identifiable by electronic means. As long as this file exist the same identification (IFID) will be used. If it does not exist, a new one will automatically be generated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_compiler_switches">A.2. Compiler Switches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run the compiler from a command line you can get information about which switches it supports using the <code>-help</code> switch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>alan -help</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some examples of other switches:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-charset</code> select the character set of the input files. This can be handy when you get a source file written on another platform, or for Windows where you edit in a Windows editor (ISO characters) and use the compiler in a DOS window (DOS characters). The option should be followed with one of the keywords <code>iso</code>, <code>mac</code> or <code>dos</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-verbose</code> print compiler version and other verbose messages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-warnings</code>, <code>-infos</code> show warning (and/or informational) messages from the compilation process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-import</code> add a directory to the search path for imported files (see <a href="#_filenames">Sect. 4.5</a> for details on the <code>import</code> statement). This switch can be used multiple times, each adding a new directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-listing</code> direct compiler output (error messages etc.) to a file with the same base name as the input (source) file, but with the extension <strong>.lis</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-full</code> will produce a complete listing of the source on the screen, or if combined with the <code>-listing</code> option, in the listing file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-debug</code> include debugging information in the produced adventure files (same as the debug option, see <a href="#_options">Sect. 3.2</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-pack</code> encode and compress the text data (same as the pack option, see <a href="#_options">Sect. 3.2</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-summary</code> produce a summary about number of actors, size of adventure files, timing information etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-dump</code> print the internal form (developers use mainly)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Giving an extra hyphen before the option reverses its meaning (where appropriate), e.g. <code>--warnings</code> means don&#8217;t show warnings. Switches may be abbreviated as long as they are unambiguous.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_running_the_adventure">A.3. Running the Adventure</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To play the generated adventure the Alan interpreter, <strong>arun</strong>, is executed with the adventure name as a parameter. For example</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>$ arun adventure</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No extension on the adventure name is allowed, the <strong>.a3c</strong> and, if applicable, <strong>.a3r</strong> files are found automatically from that name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On platforms with graphical user interfaces to which <strong>arun</strong> has been natively ported will allow double clicking a game file to start a game, or double clicking the interpreter application icon, in which case a dialogue requesting a game will appear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the interpreter program is copied to a different name, it will automatically look for a game file with the same name. Any parameters or switches will be ignored. For example, by copying the <strong>arun</strong> program to <strong>adventure</strong> the interpreter will, when started under the new name, directly look for the file <strong>adventure.a3c</strong>. The files <strong>adventure</strong> and <strong>adventure.a3c</strong> thus makes a complete game package, which is easy to start using the single command:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>$ adventure</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_interpreter_switches">A.4. Interpreter Switches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interpreter supports the following switches:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>-v</code> print the version of the interpreter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-d</code> print the version of interpreter and enter debug mode</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-i</code> ignore CRC and version errors in the adventure files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-t[&lt;n&gt;]</code> various levels of execution trace, higher &lt;n&gt; gives more details</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>-l</code> log all player command in a log-file in the current directory</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Debugging support is described in <a href="#_debugging">Sect. 6.14</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_a_sample_interaction">Appendix B: A Sample Interaction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to give you an idea of what playing an adventure might be like, if you do not have done that, this appendix lists a typical, and authentic, interaction between a player and a game. Player input is preceded by a prompt (&#8216;&gt;&#8217;) and is emphasised for clarity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reading this through, you will find that it is possible to use more or less full imperative statements to communicate with the game. However, you may leave out non-important words and the game usually provides a set of common abbreviations, such as &#8216;w&#8217; for &#8216;west&#8217;, which really means &#8216;go west&#8217;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This appendix describes the errors that may occur during the running of the adventure, i.e. during interpretation of the generated Acode. There are two classes of errors, player input response messages and system errors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Input response errors are not fatal but abort the execution of the current player command and discard the rest of the user input, which is a normal part of the interaction between the player and the Alan run-time system. System errors <em>are</em> fatal and abort the execution of the adventure.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_input_response_messages">C.1. Input Response Messages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various messages are printed for the benefit of the player. Most messages probably come from the adventure itself, i.e. they where provided by the adventure author. However, some messages can be given directly by the Arun interpreter. They are presented below using the Alan STRING-format, i.e. containing the special character combinations described in <a href="#_output_statements"><em>Output Statements</em></a>. These standard messages exist for all languages and the default value of the texts are selected depending upon the setting of the language option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The contents of any message may be modified using the <code>Message</code> statement (see <a href="#_messages">Sect. 3.14</a>). The identifier on the first line of a message explanation is the identifier that should be used in the <code>Message</code> statement to change the contents of that message. The text after the colon on the first line is the default English message text. Then follows a short explanation, including possible availability of parameters and their types.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All messages are available in all supported languages but below the English texts are shown.</p>

<p>Although the default values of the messages are static strings, it is possible to create messages that are more dynamic. The <code>Message</code> statement allows any statements, not only strings, and supplies dynamic values as parameters for many messages. See <a href="#_messages">Sect. 3.14</a> for details.</p>

<p>Multiple objects (or actors) matched the words given by the player. More adjectives are necessary to distinguish between them. The three messages are used to list the possibilities. The player can repeat the command with a more precise wording. The first message is used for the first alternative, the last for the last alternative and the middle for all the middle alternatives.</p>

<p>This message is shown when a <code>LOOK</code> statement is executed as a result of a <code>LOOK</code>! The <code>LOOK</code> statement should only be used in verb bodies.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Locating a location that would create a recursive loop of locations containing each other.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Non-existing parameter referenced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A parameter that wasn&#8217;t available was referenced. This is probably due to using a parameter shorthand such as $2 inside a string in a context where the syntax was restricted to only one parameter. This may avoided by using the <code>Say</code> statement instead of the embedded string parameter references, which would allow compile time checking, thus avoiding the risk of having this happen to the player.</p>

<h3 id="_description_2">D.1. Description</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Alan language is in this manual defined using a BNF-form, which you can see in most descriptions. The grammar is a set of rules defining what constructs are legal in the source for an Alan program. Below follows a brief explanation on how to interpret these rules by using some short examples. For details on the actual rules, refer to the content of <a href="#_language_reference">Chapter 3</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BNF form divides the rules for structure of the input source by describing it in smaller parts, which may in turn be defined by other rules. For example, a rule might say that an <strong>ADVENTURE</strong> (in this case an Alan program) consists of options, declarations and a start section. This grammar rule would look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ebnf" data-lang="ebnf">adventure = [options] {declaration} start_section</code></pre>

<p>For each message, a short description of the error, possible causes etc. are given. Each message reported also indicates the severity of that error. The message is supplemented with an indication of its severity. An informational message (indicated by the letter &#8216;I&#8217;) simply gives some information to the user, a warning message (&#8216;W&#8217;) indicates an error but the compilation still generates a valid output (although not always what the user intended). Error messages (&#8216;E&#8217;) indicate errors that have made it impossible to generate any output, but the compiler will continue to process all input. Fatal (&#8216;F&#8217;) and system (&#8216;S&#8217;) messages always terminate the compilation process immediately.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be able to use the same body for different verbs by supplying them in a comma-separated list in the verb header they must all be compatible.

<p>312 Parameter not uniquely defined as %1, which is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In certain contexts it is necessary to refer to a particular type of entity, e.g. the <code>IN</code> expression must refer to a container or an object with the container property.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>315 Attribute not defined for '%1'.</p>

<p>320 Word '%1' belongs to multiple word classes (%2 and %3).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A word was declared as to belong to different word classes such as noun, verb, adjective etc. Only multiple declarations that may lead to unexpected behaviour are reported, usually because of limitations in the current implementation. Generally it is allowed to declare a word e.g. as both an adjective and a noun.</p>

<p>332 Type of local attribute must match default attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An attribute declared locally (within an object, actor or location) that has the same name as a default attribute, has to have the same type (Boolean, integer or string).</p>

<p>401 Actor reference required outside Actor specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside an actor specification it is permissible to leave out the actor reference in a <code>USE</code> statement in which case the surrounding actor is assumed. Outside actor specifications, the actor reference must always be supplied.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>402 An Actor can&#8217;t be inside a Container.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>405 The class of a parameter used in %1 must be uniquely defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In some statements the class of the identifier must be determined during compile time. This is, for example, the case in <code>MAKE</code> and <code>SET</code> statements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>406 A parameter defined as Container have no default attributes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A parameter that was restricted to containers do not have any default attributes. Actors, objects and locations have separate sets of default attributes.

<p>409 No parameter defined in this context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No parameter is defined in the context where a reference to <code>OBJECT</code> was made. Parameters are only defined within checks and bodies of verbs, so the use of <code>OBJECT</code> (an obsolete construct, use the parameter identifier instead) is also restricted to those contexts.

<p>411 %1 ignored for Actor 'hero'.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is allowed to redefine the predefined actor <code>HERO</code> (the player). This makes it possible to define local attributes and descriptions for the hero. However any definition of scripts or initial location is ignored (the script is supplied by the player in his input and the initial location is defined in the <code>START</code> section).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>412 'ACTOR' is not allowed inside events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In events no actor is active. This means that no reference to the active actor can be made. See <a href="#_run_time_contexts"><em>Run-time Contexts</em></a>.</p>

<p>417 Comparing two constant entities will always yield the same result.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The expression compared two identifiers none of which was a parameter. This will always give the same result. This is probably an error, but the message is still a warning as it gives a perfectly running adventure (but, perhaps not what you intended?).</p>

<h2 id="_localization">Appendix G: Localization</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create adventures in languages other than English, there are a few separate issues to consider. The sections below describes the support that Alan provides for each of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_characterglyph_availability">G.1. Character/Glyph availability</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most languages have characters, or glyphs, other than the common ones used in English, like ö, Ñ or æ. Alan uses a character encoding called ISO-8859-1 which allows for many characters (but not all) used in European and other countries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make use of these characters you just need to make sure that the adventure text files use this character encoding. Usually you can do this in the editor you are using, often when you save a file the first time, or there should be a setting in your operating system to define the default encoding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the Alan source files are encoded using ISO-8859-1 they will be presented correctly when the game is run using e.g. WinArun. If you run the games in console mode you have to ensure that both your console program and your operating system are set (and able) to show characters using the ISO-8859-1 encoding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_standard_messages">G.2. Standard messages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two main types of messages that are output by interpreter to the player. They are initiated by various parts of the Alan system. The built in messages are built in to the compiler (see <a href="#_input_response_messages">Sect. C.1</a>) but can be changed to messages in the available languages. If you are using any of the available standard libraries, that library also issues messages, often overriding the messages built-in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only way to translate messages in the library is to translate the library. This is probably what you want to do anyway, since most of the verbs would be in English.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messages built into the compiler are generated automatically into the game file, e.g. as error messages like &#8220;You can&#8217;t do that.&#8221; These can either be changed by the Language option (if the language of your choice is already supported), or translated using the Message statement. <a href="#_run_time_messages">Appendix C</a> lists all such messages and their content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few special words that are currently not author translatable, as described in <a href="#_predefined_player_words">Appendix E</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_player_words">G.3. Player words</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TBD.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_word_variations">G.4. Word variations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TBD. &lt;Text about using multiple names for the same objects &amp; synonyms, and how the interpreter chooses which word to use when&gt;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_word_order">G.5. Word order</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>TBD. &lt;Text about how the rigid word order (verb first, possibly prefixed with a noun) that Alan imposes. Or does it? With the noun first is it possible to implement &#8220;das buch nehmen&#8221; with the syntax take = (o) nehmen?&gt;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_portability_of_games">Appendix H: Portability of Games</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adventure files produced by the Alan compiler is compatible across all supported platforms. This means that by copying the binary <em>*.a3c*</em> file (and any <em>*.a3r*</em> file if available) to another machine it should be possible to run the game on that new machine without any changes. Note however that the files must be transferred in <em>binary</em> mode (where applicable). All characters are automatically converted to the native set allowing multi-national characters to be presented correctly even on machines that do not support the ISO-8859-1 standard. This is of course restricted to characters having a representation in the current native character set.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a strong goal to achieve complete portability of the games to be able to provide games for all supported platforms without re-compilation. Game authors are encouraged to seriously consider this when designing games and not use any system specific characters, character combinations or special commands that may be available on some systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Portability between different versions of the system is not guaranteed. Again, it is a strong goal to be backwards compatible, at least between different builds within the same major version. This means that the most recent v3 interpreter should run games from all previous v3 compilers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changes in the game file format may occur between versions, which may or may not be compatible. Conversion tools may be available, older interpreter versions can be requested.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, in short, the interpreter Arun and any game produced using the Alan System is yours. You may sell or copy it as you like, and as you need the interpreter to run the game, it may be copied freely too. The Arun interpreter may also be uploaded on BBS&#8217;es or FTP-sites to allow players to download an interpreter for his platform and use that to run your game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The documentation and examples are free to copy or place on any BBS&#8217;es or FTP-sites if their contents are not changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you create a game using the Alan System, we&#8217;d very much like to see it. Send us a copy (preferably in source) and any documentation or a description of the game and its novel features. We will of course honour any copy-restrictions that you might want to place on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Short games or samples of Alan source are also most welcome as examples that we might use and distribute to other users. Sending an example means that you waive all rights to it. If you also supply a walkthrough to your example it will be added to the growing suite of test data and thus help us further improve the quality of the Alan system.</p>
