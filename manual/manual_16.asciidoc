= Copying Conditions

The Alan System is distributed under the https://www.perlfoundation.org/artistic-license-20.html[*Artistic License 2.0*] for which the full text follows.
The intent of this licensing is that the Copyright Holder retain some control over the development of the Alan System, while still keeping it available as open source and free software.

In practical terms this means that the licensing is chosen so that it should be possible to:

* freely distribute games produced with the Alan system, including for profit
* re-distribute compiled versions of the Alan system, including together with a game which is not open source or free, provided there is no charge for the Alan system
* redistribute compiled and/or source versions of the original Alan system (the Standard Version)
* acquire the source code for the Standard Version
* modify the source code for private use
* re-distribute compiled and/or source of a Modified Version provided they are done so under a compatible license with appropriate attribution *and* that the modification is described and made available, preferably by returning it to the Copyright Holder so that it can be merged into the Standard Version

== Artistic License 2.0


[discrete]
=== Preamble

This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed.
The intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free software.

You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package.
If the terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.


[discrete]
=== Definitions

"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the copyright notice for the entire Package.

"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.

"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify the Package.

"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files.
A given Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.

"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of your company or organization.

"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or providing support for this Package to another party.
It does not mean licensing fees.

"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.

"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The Copyright Holder in the future.

"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration files for the Package.

"Compiled" form means the compiled byte code, object code, binary, or any other form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.


[discrete]
=== Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution

["arabic", start=1]
. You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute the Modified Version.


[discrete]
=== Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version

["arabic", start=2]
. You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
At your discretion, such verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.

. You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications made available from the Copyright Holder.
The resulting Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original License.


[discrete]
=== Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source

["arabic", start=4]
. You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
[loweralpha]
.. make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include your modifications in the Standard Version.
.. ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user installing or running the Standard Version.
In addition, the Modified Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.
.. allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under
[lowerroman]
... the Original License or
... a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.


[discrete]
=== Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions without the Source

["arabic", start=5]
. You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the Standard Version.
Such instructions must be valid at the time of your distribution.
If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution.
If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.

. You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the Modified Version.


[discrete]
=== Aggregating or Linking the Package

["arabic", start=7]
. You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package.
Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are permitted.
The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.

. You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or byte code versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.


[discrete]
=== Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version

["arabic", start=9]
. Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a Modified Version.
In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.


[discrete]
=== General Provisions

["arabic", start=10]
. Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License.
By using, modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this license.
Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.

. If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.

. This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service mark, trade name, or logo of the Copyright Holder.

. This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package.

== Executive Summary

So, in short, the interpreter Arun and any game produced using the Alan System is yours.
You may sell or copy it as you like, and as you need the interpreter to run the game, it may be copied freely too.
The Arun interpreter may also be uploaded on BBS'es or FTP-sites to allow players to download an interpreter for his platform and use that to run your game.

The documentation and examples are free to copy or place on any BBS'es or FTP-sites if their contents are not changed.

If you create a game using the Alan System, we'd very much like to see it.
Send us a copy (preferably in source) and any documentation or a description of the game and its novel features.
We will of course honour any copy-restrictions that you might want to place on it.

Short games or samples of Alan source are also most welcome as examples that we might use and distribute to other users.
Sending an example means that you waive all rights to it.
If you also supply a walkthrough to your example it will be added to the growing suite of test data and thus help us further improve the quality of the Alan system.
