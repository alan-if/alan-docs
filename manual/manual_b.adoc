[appendix]
= A Sample Interaction

In order to give you an idea of what playing an adventure might be like, if you do not have done that, this appendix lists a typical, and authentic, interaction between a player and a game.
Player input is preceded by a prompt ('&gt;') and is emphasised for clarity.

In reading this through, you will find that it is possible to use more or less full imperative statements to communicate with the game.
However, you may leave out non-important words and the game usually provides a set of common abbreviations, such as '`w`' for '`west`', which really means '`go west`'.

It is also common to provide possibility to refer to multiple objects in a command, either by use of '`all`' or specifically listing the objects.

Your input is in italics.

================================================================================
*West of House.* +
Welcome to Dungeon (ALAN Demo). This version created 29-FEB-92.

You are in an open field west of a big white house with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here.

&gt; _examine the mailbox_ +
I see nothing special about the mailbox.

&gt; _open it_ +
The small mailbox is now open. The small mailbox contains a leaflet.

&gt; _take the leaflet and read it_ +
Taken! +
'I hope you have noticed that this isn't your usual Dungeon but rather an ALAN implementation brought to you by +
{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}{nbsp}ThoNi & GorFo Adventure Factories +
Happy Adventuring!'

&gt; _inventory_ +
You are carrying a leaflet.

&gt; _go south_ +
*South of House.* +
You are facing the south side of a white house. There is no door here, and all the windows are barred.

&gt; _east_ +
*Behind House.* +
You are behind the white house. In one corner of the house there is a window which is slightly ajar.

&gt; _open the window_ +
With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.

&gt; _go in_ +
*Kitchen.* +
You are in the kitchen of the white house. A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. On the table you can see an elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers and a clear glass bottle. A passage leads to the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward. To the east is a small window which is open.

&gt; _examine all_ +
You can't refer to multiple objects with 'examine'.

&gt; _take all_ +
(elongated brown sack, smelling of hot peppers) Taken! +
(clear glass bottle) Taken!

&gt; _up_ +
*Upstairs.* +
You are in the attic. The only exit is stairs that lead down. A large coil of rope is lying in the corner. There is a square brick here which feels like clay. A nasty-looking knife is lying here.

&gt; _take all_ +
(rope) Taken! +
(square clay brick) Taken! +
(nasty knife) Taken!

&gt; _examine knife_ +
I see nothing special about the knife.

&gt; _down_ +
*Kitchen (again)* +
A table seems to have been used recently for the preparation of food. The table is empty. To the east is a small window which is open.

&gt; _w_ +
*Living room.* +
You are in the living room. There is a door to the east. To the west is a wooden door with strange gothic lettering, which appears to be nailed shut. There is a trophy case here. In the center of the room is a large oriental rug.

On hooks above the mantlepiece hangs an elvish sword of great antiquity. A battery-powered brass lantern is on the trophy case. There is an issue of US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT dated 29-FEB-92 here.

&gt; _move rug_ +
With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room. With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.

&gt; _open door_ +
I don't know which door you mean.

&gt; _open trap door_ +
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending into darkness.

&gt; _take the sword, the lantern and the issue_ +
(rug) The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried. +
(elvish sword) Taken! +
(battery brass lantern) Taken! +
(issue) Taken!

&gt; _read issue_ +
