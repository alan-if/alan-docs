# About The XSL Stylesheets

The original XSL stylesheets in this folder tree were taken from the "`/src/dist/docbook-xsl/`" folder of the [asciidoctor-fopub] project, Copyright (C) 2013 Dan Allen (MIT License):

- https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-fopub/tree/9afeab8/src/dist/docbook-xsl

They were subsequently edited by Tristano Ajmone to adapt them to the styling needs of the _Alan Manual_ project. The adaptation work may include deleting some of the original files, as well as adding new ones.
